**Synonyms:** Some synonyms for Tanz include "Bewegung" (movement) and "Rhythmus" (rhythm), as they are two important elements of dancing.

**Examples:** Tanz can be enjoyed by people in various forms, such as ballet, tango, salsa, waltz, and hip hop dance styles. Dancing is also a form of exercise that can help improve cardiovascular health, balance, and flexibility.

Overall, Tanz is an important part of culture and social life in Germany, and is a fun way to express oneself creatively while also getting active.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Tanz" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Tanz%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
