## Definition

The German word "Hund" translates to "dog" in English. It refers to a domesticated carnivorous mammal that is often kept as a pet or used for various tasks, such as hunting, herding, and guarding. Dogs are known for their loyalty, playfulness, and their ability to form strong bonds with humans.

## Opposite

The opposite of "Hund" would be "Katze" (cat). While dogs are usually associated with loyalty and obedience, cats are more independent and known for their aloof behavior. Whereas dogs are typically larger in size and rely on their sense of smell, cats are smaller and have a highly developed sense of hearing.

## Synonyms

There are several synonyms for "Hund" in German, such as:

- **Rüde**: This term specifically refers to a male dog.
- **Hündin**: This term specifically refers to a female dog.
- **Wauwau**: An informal synonym often used by children to refer to a dog.

## Examples

Here are a few examples that demonstrate the usage of the word "Hund" in sentences:

1. Mein Hund freut sich immer, wenn ich nach Hause komme. (My dog always gets excited when I come home.)
2. Die Nachbarin hat einen kleinen und verspielten Hund. (The neighbor has a small and playful dog.)
3. Ich gehe jeden Tag mit meinem Hund spazieren. (I walk my dog every day.)

Note: The word "Hund" can also be used metaphorically in German to describe someone who is untrustworthy or behaves like a dog.
