**Definitions:**
1. Pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others.
2. Enjoyment obtained from the troubles of others.

**Opposites:**
While there is no direct antonym for Schadenfreude, the opposite sentiment can be described as empathy or compassion. Instead of finding joy in someone else's suffering, these emotions involve understanding and feeling sympathetic towards others' challenges or difficulties.

**Synonyms:**

2. "The tabloid newspaper thrived on gossip and Schadenfreude, delighting in exposing celebrities' personal struggles."

Schadenfreude is a complex emotion, often criticized for its negative connotations. While it may briefly provide satisfaction, it ultimately reflects a lack of empathy and understanding towards others.
