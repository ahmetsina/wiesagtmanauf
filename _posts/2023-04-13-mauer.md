Mauer (f): wall, barrier, rampart

Defintions:
A Mauer is a structure built to enclose, divide, or protect an area. It is commonly made of brick, stone, or concrete and can be used for various purposes like security, privacy, or decoration. In Berlin, the word is often associated with the Berlin Wall which separated East and West Berlin during the Cold War.

Opposites:
The opposite of Mauer is Ã–ffnung which means opening or gap in English. If a wall or barrier is broken, damaged, or has an opening, then it is no longer a Mauer.

Synonyms:
Some synonyms for Mauer include Mauerwerk (masonry), Wand (wall), and Bastion (rampart). All of these words are related to the idea of a physical structure that divides or protects an area.

Examples:
- Die Mauer umgibt das Schloss. (The wall surrounds the castle.)
- Wir haben die Mauer gestrichen. (We painted the wall.)
- Der Feind hat die Mauer durchbrochen. (The enemy breached the rampart.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Mauer" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Mauer%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
