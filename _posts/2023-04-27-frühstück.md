Frühstück is a German word that refers to the first meal of the day - breakfast. This meal is typically eaten in the morning and is considered to be the most important meal of the day. It is derived from two German words, "früh" meaning early and "Stück" meaning piece.

### Synonyms

There are several synonyms for Frühstück in German such as "Morgenmahlzeit", "Zmorge" (Swiss German), and "Frühschoppen" which means breakfast with alcohol. However, Frühstück is the most commonly used term.
