Schnitzel is a German word that refers to a flat, breaded, and pan-fried piece of meat. It is a popular dish in Germany and Austria, and it is usually made with pork, veal, or chicken. The meat is pounded thin, coated in flour, dipped in egg wash, and then coated in breadcrumbs before being fried.

Some synonyms for Schnitzel include Wiener Schnitzel, which is a breaded veal cutlet, and Schnitzel Wiener Art, which is a breaded pork cutlet that is prepared in the same manner as Wiener Schnitzel.

The opposite of Schnitzel could be a vegetarian or vegan dish, such as a vegetable stir-fry or a tofu curry. 

Here are some examples of how Schnitzel is used in German:

- Ich h√§tte gerne ein Schnitzel mit Pommes, bitte. (I would like a Schnitzel with fries, please.)
- Schnitzel ist eines meiner Lieblingsgerichte. (Schnitzel is one of my favorite dishes.)
- Das Schnitzel war heute besonders knusprig. (The Schnitzel was particularly crispy today.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schnitzel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schnitzel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
