The German word "Garten" is a noun, referring to a garden in English. Here are the different aspects related to this word:

## Definitions
1. **Refers to an outdoor space:** A "Garten" is an enclosed outdoor area, usually adjoining a house or a building, where plants, flowers, and sometimes trees are grown. It serves as a recreational and aesthetically pleasing area for relaxation and leisure activities.

2. **Symbolizes nature:** A "Garten" represents the beauty of nature, and it often showcases a variety of plants and vibrant colors. It can be utilized for various purposes, including gardening, reading, or socializing.

## Opposites
- **Innenraum:** In contrast to "Garten," which means an outdoor garden, "Innenraum" refers to an indoor space or premises.

- **Stadt:** While a "Garten" is typically found in suburban or rural areas, "Stadt" is the German word for city, representing the urban environment with limited access to natural green spaces.

## Synonyms
While there are no direct synonyms for "Garten" in German, here are some related terms that imply similar meanings:

- **Hof:** This term refers to a courtyard or yard, often closed off by surrounding buildings, where plants can be cultivated. Though it is usually smaller than a "Garten," it serves similar purposes.

- **Park:** Although larger and more communal, a "Park" shares some similarities with a "Garten" as it is an open space dedicated to growing plants and providing recreational activities for visitors.

## Examples
