**Kühlschrank** is a common word in German language, and refers to a refrigerator or fridge in English. It is composed of two words "Kühl" and "Schrank", where "Kühl" means cool or cold, and "Schrank" means cupboard or closet. Thus, Kühlschrank can be translated as "cool cupboard".

Some synonyms for Kühlschrank are "Frischhaltebox" and "Kühlgerät". On the other hand, there are no commonly used antonyms for the word Kühlschrank, because it represents a specific type of appliance and doesn't have an opposite in that sense.
