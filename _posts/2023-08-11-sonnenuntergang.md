## Definitions

Sonnenuntergang literally translates to "sunset" in English. It refers to the natural phenomenon of the daily disappearance of the sun below the horizon. The word can be broken down to "Sonnen" meaning "sun" and "Untergang" meaning "setting" or "downfall". 

In a figurative sense, Sonnenuntergang can also refer to the end of a particular phase or the decline of something, just like the setting of the sun marks the end of the day.

## Opposites

- Sonnenaufgang: This is the opposite of Sonnenuntergang, meaning "sunrise" in English. While Sonnenuntergang marks the end of the day, Sonnenaufgang refers to the beginning of the day when the sun rises above the horizon.

## Synonyms

- Abendrot: This is a synonym for Sonnenuntergang and specifically describes the reddish or orange coloration of the sky during the sunset hours.
