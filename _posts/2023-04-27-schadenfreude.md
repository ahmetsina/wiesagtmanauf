Schadenfreude is a German term that refers to the pleasure derived from another person's misfortune. It can also be translated as "harm-joy" or "damage-joy". The word is derived from schaden, which means "harm" or "damage", and freude, which means "joy" or "pleasure".

The opposite of Schadenfreude is "Mitleid" which means "compassion" or "sympathy". Instead of taking pleasure in someone's misfortune, if you feel Mitleid, you feel sorry for them.

Some synonyms for Schadenfreude include:

- Sadism: Taking pleasure in inflicting pain or suffering on others.
- Gloating: Feeling satisfaction or pleasure in one's own success or someone else's failure.
- Schadenlust: Another German term with a similar meaning.

Examples of Schadenfreude include:

- Laughing when someone trips and falls.
- Feeling pleased when a rival company goes out of business.
- Taking satisfaction when someone you dislike fails to achieve their goals. 

It is important to note that while there is no direct equivalent term in English, the concept of Schadenfreude is recognized across cultures. It is a human emotion that most people have experienced at some point in their lives. It is also important to be mindful of these feelings and try to avoid taking pleasure in other people's suffering.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
