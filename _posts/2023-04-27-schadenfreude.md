Schadenfreude is a German word that has been adopted by the English language. At its core, it means taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune. The closest English words to schadenfreude are probably "malicious glee" or "delight in another's pain."

**Definitions**

Schadenfreude is a feeling of pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others. It is often described as a guilty pleasure, as it is not considered a particularly admirable trait. The term is derived from the German words "Schaden," meaning harm, and "Freude," meaning joy.

**Opposites**

The opposite of schadenfreude is empathy, where you feel the pain and struggles of others and want to alleviate their suffering. It is important to note that feeling empathy does not mean you have to cater to someone's every need. It means acknowledging the pain they are feeling and trying to offer some kind of help or comfort.

**Synonyms**

There are a few English words that are similar in meaning to schadenfreude. These include "malice," "spite," and "malevolence." However, these words tend to emphasize the intention to harm, rather than the pleasure derived from someone else's misfortune.

**Examples**

Here are a few examples of schadenfreude in action:

- Laughing at someone who falls down in a public place
- Taking pleasure in a rival team's loss
- Gossiping about someone's misfortunes

In general, it is not a good idea to indulge in schadenfreude. It can lead to a lack of empathy and a tendency to revel in negative emotions. Instead, try to focus on being happy for the good things that happen to others, even if they are not happening to you.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
