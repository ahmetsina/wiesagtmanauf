### Definition

**Haus** is a common German noun that translates to "house" in English. It refers to a building used as a place of residence or refuge by an individual, family, or group of people. A *Haus* typically provides shelter, space for living, and protection from the elements.

### Opposites

- *Wohnung*: This is the German word for "apartment," which refers to a part of a larger building or complex, used for residential purposes. While a *Haus* represents an entire stand-alone structure, *Wohnung* refers to a specific unit within a residential building or complex.

- *Zelt*: Meaning "tent" in English, this term represents the opposite of a *Haus*. Unlike a house, which is a permanent structure, a *Zelt* is a temporary shelter made from fabric or other materials.

### Synonyms

- *Wohnstätte*: This German noun is comparable to "dwelling" or "place of residence" in English. It encompasses the broader concept of a living space, similar to *Haus*.

- *Behausung*: Meaning "habitation" in English, this term refers to any type of living place. It can be used as a synonym for *Haus* but is more general in its scope.

### Examples

1. Ich wohne in einem kleinen Haus in der Nähe des Flusses. (I live in a small house near the river.)

2. Unser Haus hat einen wunderschönen Garten. (Our house has a beautiful garden.)

3. Viele Menschen träumen von einem Haus am Strand. (Many people dream of a beach house.)

4. Sie hat ein großes Haus mit fünf Schlafzimmern und drei Badezimmern. (She has a large house with five bedrooms and three bathrooms.)

In conclusion, *Haus* is a fundamental German word that refers to a house, providing shelter and space for living. It can be distinguished from other related terms such as *Wohnung* (apartment) and *Zelt* (tent). Synonyms like *Wohnstätte* and *Behausung* encompass the concept of dwelling as well. With its versatility, *Haus* plays a crucial role in everyday conversations and descriptions of living spaces in the German language.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Haus" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Haus%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
