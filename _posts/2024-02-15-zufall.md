## Definition

Zufall (noun) is a German word that translates to "coincidence" or "randomness" in English. It refers to an event that occurs by chance and cannot be predicted or controlled.

## Opposites

1. Vorhersehbarkeit: which means "predictability." This is the opposite of Zufall, indicating that an event can be foreseen or expected.
2. Absicht: which means "intention" or "purpose." While Zufall refers to things happening by chance, Absicht suggests that something occurs due to a deliberate plan or motive.

## Synonyms

1. Glück: which means "luck." Both Zufall and Glück highlight the element of chance, emphasizing that something happens without a specific cause or intention.
2. Schicksal: which translates to "fate" or "destiny." Similar to Zufall, Schicksal refers to events that occur without human influence. However, Schicksal often carries a connotation of a pre-determined outcome.

## Examples

1. Es war ein reiner Zufall, dass wir uns in der Ferienwohnung getroffen haben. (It was pure coincidence that we ran into each other at the vacation rental.)
2. In der Lotterie gewinnen ist vom Zufall abhängig. (Winning the lottery is dependent on chance.)
3. Durch Zufall habe ich das Buch, von dem du sprichst, in einer Buchhandlung entdeckt. (By chance, I stumbled upon the book you're talking about in a bookstore.)

Remember, Zufall emphasizes the unexpected and the absence of intention. It often adds an element of surprise to everyday occurrences.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Zufall" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Zufall%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
