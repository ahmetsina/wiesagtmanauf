## Streifen

### Definition:

**Streifen** is a German word that translates to "stripes" in English. It can refer to lines or bands of color or texture that appear in a pattern.

### Opposites:

- **Eben:** "even" or "smooth" could be considered the opposite of **Streifen**, as it implies a lack of lines or patterns.

- **Gleichförmig:** "uniform" or "consistent" could also be seen as the opposite of **Streifen**, as it suggests a lack of variation in a surface.

### Synonyms:

- **Linien:** "lines" is a synonym to some extent, as it shares the idea of shapes that stretch out in one direction.

- **Muster:** "patterns" is another synonym that could be related to **Streifen**, as patterns often involve the repetition of lines or shapes.

### Examples:

1. Die Streifen auf ihrem Pullover waren bunt und fröhlich.
   (The stripes on her sweater were colorful and cheerful.)

2. Die Streifen auf der Straße weisen darauf hin, dass das Parken hier verboten ist.
   (The stripes on the road indicate that parking is prohibited here.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Streifen" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Streifen%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
