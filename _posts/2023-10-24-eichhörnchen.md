## Definition
Eichhörnchen is a German noun that refers to a little creature known as a "squirrel" in English. It is a small mammal belonging to the Sciuridae family, commonly found in forests, parks, and gardens.

## Opposite
The opposite of Eichhörnchen would be "Raubtier," which translates to "predator" in English. Unlike squirrels, predators are animals that hunt, kill, and eat other animals for survival.

## Synonyms
Although Eichhörnchen is the most commonly used term for squirrels in German, there are a few regional synonyms that can be used interchangeably, such as "Hörnchen," "Rotecke," or "Rötelschwänzchen."

## Examples
