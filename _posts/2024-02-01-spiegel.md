## Definition

"Spiegel" is a German noun that translates to "mirror" in English. It refers to a reflective surface that allows one to see their own image or an object placed in front of it.

## Opposite

The opposite of "Spiegel" is "Blind", meaning "blind." While a "Spiegel" reflects light and images, "Blind" does not allow any light to pass through and thus does not produce any reflection.

## Synonyms

Some synonyms for "Spiegel" include:

- **Reflexion** - This term is also used to describe a mirror, referring to the reflection of light or an image.
- **Glas** - Although "Glas" primarily means "glass," it can also be used to refer to a mirror made of glass.
