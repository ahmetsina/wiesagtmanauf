Schadenfreude is a German word that translates to "harm-joy" in English. It refers to the feeling of pleasure or satisfaction one experiences from another person's misfortune or suffering. 

Some synonyms of Schadenfreude include gloating, delight, and pleasure. Meanwhile, its opposite would be empathy or compassion. 

Examples of Schadenfreude include laughing at someone who trips and falls or feeling happy when a rival fails. While the feeling may be satisfying in the moment, it is not a healthy or positive emotion to hold onto. 

In fact, research has shown that those who experience Schadenfreude are more likely to have negative personality traits such as aggression and narcissism. It is important to recognize and acknowledge when we may be experiencing Schadenfreude and work towards cultivating more positive emotions in our lives.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---
