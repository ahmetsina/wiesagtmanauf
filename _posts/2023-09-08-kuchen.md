**Definition:** 

*Kuchen* means "cake" in English. It refers to a sweet baked dessert made from a mixture of flour, sugar, eggs, and additional ingredients such as butter, milk, or flavorings. Kuchen is often enjoyed during special occasions or as a treat with coffee or tea.

**Opposites:**

The opposite of *Kuchen* would be *Salzgebäck*, meaning "savoury pastry" or "salty snack." Unlike *Kuchen,* which is typically sweet, *Salzgebäck* includes snacks such as pretzels, salted sticks, or cheese-filled pastries.

**Synonyms:**

While *Kuchen* already specifies the type of dessert, some common synonyms for it include *Torte* (gateau) and *Gebäck* (baked goods). These words can be interchanged to refer to a variety of cakes or pastries.

**Examples:**

1. Ich habe gestern einen Schokoladenkuchen gebacken. (Yesterday, I baked a chocolate cake.)
2. Hast du Lust auf ein Stück Kuchen? (Do you feel like having a piece of cake?)
3. Meine Oma backt den besten Käsekuchen der Welt. (My grandma bakes the best cheesecake in the world.)
4. Der Geburtstagstisch war reichlich mit Kuchen und Torten gedeckt. (The birthday table was abundantly stocked with cakes and gateaux.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Kuchen" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Kuchen%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
