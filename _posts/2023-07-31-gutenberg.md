## Definitions:

**Gutenberg** is a German noun that refers to Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of the mechanical movable type printing press. He played a pivotal role in the development of the printing press, enabling the mass production of books and other printed materials.

Additionally, "Gutenberg" can also be used to refer to the Gutenberg Galaxy, a term coined by Marshall McLuhan. It represents the emergence of a new era of communication and knowledge dissemination brought about by the printing press.

## Opposites:

The opposite of Gutenberg, in terms of the printing press, would be **manuscript**, which represents handwritten documents prior to the invention of the printing press. Manuscripts required extensive time and effort to produce copies, limiting the distribution of information.
