Schadenfreude is a German word that has gained popularity worldwide. Translated into English, Schadenfreude means taking pleasure in the pain or misfortune of others. The word is a compound of two German words, Schaden which means harm and Freude which means joy. So, it is the joy derived from someone else's pain.

### Definition
Schadenfreude is often used to describe the feeling of satisfaction one gets when someone they dislike fails or faces a mishap. It is a complex emotion that has been studied extensively by psychologists. Although Schadenfreude is considered a negative emotion, it is a common human emotion that is a part of our evolutionary psychology.

### Opposite
The opposite of Schadenfreude is the German word "Mitleid", which means compassion. Mitleid is the feeling of empathy and sorrow for someone else's misfortune, as opposed to feeling joy or satisfaction.

### Synonym
A close synonym of Schadenfreude is the German word "Scherz" which means a joke or prank. Scherz, however, is not associated with feeling joy from someone else's pain.

### Example
An example of Schadenfreude could be when a colleague who you don't like gets reprimanded by the boss. Instead of feeling sympathetic, you feel a sense of satisfaction that they got in trouble. Another example could be a political leader that you don't support losing an election. Instead of being happy with your preferred candidate winning, you feel happiness because the other candidate lost.

In conclusion, Schadenfreude is a complex human emotion that is often associated with negative feelings. Although it is not an admirable emotion, it is part of our psychological makeup.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---
