**Schadenfreude** is a German word that's gaining more popularity among English speakers as well. It's a compound word that comes from "schaden" meaning harm or damage, and "freude" meaning joy or pleasure. According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, Schadenfreude is defined as "a feeling of enjoyment that comes from seeing or hearing about the troubles of other people."

Synonyms of Schadenfreude include **Gloating**, **Delight** and **Mirth**. On the other hand, Antonyms of Schadenfreude include **Empathy**, **Compassion**, and **Altruism**. 

It's not exactly a positive emotion, but it's not a rare one either. Examples of Schadenfreude are not too hard to come by, especially on social media platforms. Schadenfreude is when someone takes pleasure in another's misfortune. For example, laughing when someone trips and falls, or feeling a tiny sense of satisfaction when things don't go well for an acquaintance. 

In conclusion, while Schadenfreude is a word that's often used in a negative light, it also has some comedic and cathartic properties. When used in moderation and in the right contexts, it can be a way for people to let off steam, especially when going through tough times themselves. But as with all things, too much of it can be harmful and create negative vibes.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
