**Definition**:
Apfel is the German word for apple, which is a fruit that is commonly eaten all around the world. The apple is a type of fruit that is round or oval in shape, and it typically has red or green skin with a white or yellow interior.

**Opposites**: 
The opposite of Apfel in German would be Birne, which is pear. While both fruits are similar, pears have a softer texture and a sweeter taste than apples.

**Synonyms**: 
The German language has various regional dialects, and therefore, different words for apple as well. For example, in southern Germany and Austria, they use Birapfel or Biraapfl, while in northern Germany, they call it Äppel or Eppel.

- Ich esse gerne grüne Äpfel zum Frühstuck. (I like to eat green apples for breakfast.)
