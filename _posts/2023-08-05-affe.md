## Affe

**Definition**: The German word "Affe" translates to "ape" or "monkey" in English. It refers to a group of primates characterized by their flexible limbs and grasping hands and feet.

**Opposite**: The opposite of Affe would be "Mensch" (human). While humans are primates as well, the word Affe is commonly used to specifically refer to non-human primates.

**Synonym**: Synonyms for Affe include "Schimpanse" (chimpanzee), "Gorilla" (gorilla), "Orang-Utan" (orangutan), and "Makak" (macaque).

**Example**: 
- "Der Affe h√§ngt vom Ast." (The monkey hangs from the branch.)
- "Die Zoobesucher bestaunten den Affen im Gehege." (The zoo visitors admired the monkeys in the enclosure.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Affe" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Affe%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
