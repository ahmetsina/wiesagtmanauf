## Definition

"Fussel" is a German noun that refers to small fibers or lint that accumulate on clothing or other surfaces over time. These fibers are often the result of worn or damaged fabric or textiles. Fussel can be either natural, such as wool or cotton fibers, or synthetic, such as those found in polyester or nylon materials. It is similar to the English term "fluff."

## Opposite

The opposite of Fussel would be a clean surface or garment without any lint or fibers. This is often achieved through washing or using a lint roller to remove any accumulated fuzz.

## Synonyms

Some synonyms for Fussel in German include "Flusen" or "Faserreste," which both refer to small fibers or lint.

## Examples

- "Wenn du diesen Pullover eine Weile trägst, bildet sich Fussel darauf."
(If you wear this sweater for a while, lint will accumulate on it.)

- "Vergiss nicht, vor dem Jobinterview die Fussel von deiner Kleidung zu entfernen."
(Don't forget to remove the lint from your clothes before the job interview.)

- "Die Fussel auf dem Sofa stören mich, ich sollte es mal gründlich absaugen."
(The lint on the couch is bothering me, I should vacuum it thoroughly.)

Overall, Fussel is a common occurrence on clothing and other surfaces and can be easily removed to maintain a clean and presentable appearance.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Fussel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Fussel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
