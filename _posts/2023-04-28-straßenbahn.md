**Definition:**
Straßenbahn is the German term for a tram or light rail system. It is a form of public transportation that runs on tracks on the street, typically powered by overhead wires. 

**Opposite:**
The opposite of Straßenbahn in Germany would be a bus. Buses are another form of public transportation that run on the street, but they do not have tracks and are not restricted to a specific route.

**Synonyms:**
Straßenbahn is used interchangeably with Tram, Stadtbahn or U-Bahn in some regions in Germany.

**Examples:**
The Straßenbahn system is very extensive in German cities like Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden and Frankfurt. The trams run frequently and cover many areas of the city, making it easy and convenient to get around. Tourists can buy a daily pass for the Straßenbahn, which includes unlimited use of public transportation.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Straßenbahn" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Straßenbahn%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
