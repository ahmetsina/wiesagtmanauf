## Definition 

Schadenfreude is a German word that describes delight in the misfortune of others. Schaden means harm, and freude means joy, so the word literally means "harm-joy." It is a complex and controversial emotion that is often viewed negatively.

## Synonyms

There are several words in other languages that express the idea of Schadenfreude. In English, the closest equivalent might be "malicious glee," while in French it is "joie maligne." The ancient Greeks had a word for it, epicaricacy, and in Japanese, the concept is known as "schadenfreude."

## Opposites

The opposite of Schadenfreude might be empathy or compassion. It is a difficult emotion to counteract, as it often arises unconsciously and can be difficult to recognize.

## Examples

One example of Schadenfreude might be laughing at someone who slips and falls on ice. Another might be feeling a sense of satisfaction when a rival company fails. It can also manifest as simply feeling good when someone we don't like experiences a setback or failure. However, it is important to recognize that these feelings are often fleeting and can have negative consequences for our relationships and our own well-being.

Overall, Schadenfreude is a complex emotion that is often viewed negatively. While it is natural to feel pleasure at the misfortunes of others, it is important to recognize that this emotion can have negative consequences and to strive to cultivate empathy and compassion instead.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
