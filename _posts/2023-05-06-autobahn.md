Autobahn is a German word that refers to a type of federal highway or expressway. Autobahn can be translated into English as motorway or freeway. 

One of the main features of the Autobahn is that there are no speed limits on most sections. This means that drivers can travel at very high speeds, although there are still recommended speed limits for certain sections and in certain weather conditions. 

Opposite to Autobahn is Landstraße which is a regular road, usually between towns that allows for a  maximum speed limit of 100 km/h.

The Autobahn network in Germany is extensive and covers a total distance of over 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers) throughout the country. It is one of the most advanced and efficient highway systems in the world, with a modern infrastructure that allows for a smooth and safe driving experience.

Examples of Autobahn include the A1, which connects Hamburg with Cologne, the A7 which runs north-south from Flensburg near the Danish border to Füssen on the Austrian border, and the A9 which connects Berlin and Munich. The Autobahn is an essential part of the German transportation system, and it is used by millions of people every day for both business and leisure purposes.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Autobahn" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Autobahn%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
