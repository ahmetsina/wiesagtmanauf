Spazieren

Definition: Spazieren (pronounced: shpah-tsee-ren) is a verb in the German language, which translates to "to take a walk" in English. This word is derived from the noun "Spaziergang," meaning "walk" or "stroll."

Opposites: 

1. Bleiben (to stay): While "spazieren" implies movement, "bleiben" signifies staying in one place.
2. Sitzen (to sit): Another opposite of "spazieren" is "sitzen," as it suggests being stationary rather than engaging in a walk.

Synonyms: 

1. Gehen (to go): Although "gehen" is a general term for "to go," it can be used interchangeably with "spazieren" in some contexts.
2. Spazierengehen: This compound word is created by adding the suffix "-gehen," which gives it the same meaning as "spazieren."

Examples:

1. Heute m√∂chten wir am Fluss spazieren. (Today we want to take a walk by the river.)
2. Er spaziert gerne mit seinem Hund im Park. (He enjoys walking his dog in the park.)
3. Ich werde nach dem Abendessen eine Runde spazieren gehen. (I will take a walk after dinner.)

Overall, "spazieren" is commonly used in German to describe a leisurely walk or stroll. It provides a pleasant way to enjoy nature, exercise, or simply relax.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Spazieren" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Spazieren%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
