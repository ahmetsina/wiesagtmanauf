**FAHRKARTE**

Fahrkarte is a German noun that means a ticket or a travel card. It is composed of two words "Fahr" and "Karte", where "Fahr" stands for "ride" and "Karte" means "card". Fahrkarte is frequently used in Germany for public transport, such as buses, trams, and trains.

**DEFINITIONS:**

A Fahrkarte is a document that allows the holder to use public transportation services. It can be a one-way ticket or a travel card with multiple uses.

**OPPOSITES:**

The opposite of a Fahrkarte would be a private mode of transportation. For example, taking a taxi, using a car, or riding a bike.

**SYNONYMS:**

Fahrkarte is sometimes used interchangeably with the word "Ticket". However, there are slight differences between the two. The term Fahrkarte specifically refers to a card used for transportation, while the word "Ticket" is for anything that provides admission or access to an event, attraction or transportation.

**EXAMPLES:**

- "Ich brauche eine Fahrkarte für den Bus." (I need a ticket for the bus.)
- "Ich habe eine Monatskarte als Fahrkarte für den Zug." (I have a monthly pass as a travel card for the train.)
- "Entschuldigung, ich habe meine Fahrkarte verloren."
