## Definition
Eichhörnchen is a German word that refers to a small mammal belonging to the rodent family, commonly known as a squirrel. Known for their bushy tails and agile climbing skills, Eichhörnchen are renowned for their ability to store nuts and acorns in preparation for the winter months. These creatures are characterized by their sharp claws, paws designed for grasping, and their habit of building nests called "Kobeln" in trees.

## Opposite
The opposite of Eichhörnchen is Ameise, which translates to ant in English. Unlike Eichhörnchen, Ameisen are small insects that live in colonies and typically move on the ground. While Eichhörnchen are known for their tree-dwelling nature and love for nuts, Ameisen are known for their diligent and organized behavior in collecting food and building elaborate underground tunnels.

Some synonyms for Eichhörnchen include:
- Nager (rodent)
