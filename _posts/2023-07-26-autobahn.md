## Definition

Autobahn is a German noun, which refers to a highway or motorway. It is a compound word formed by combining "auto" (meaning "car") and "bahn" (meaning "path" or "way"). The Autobahn is a symbol of German engineering and efficiency, as it is renowned for its well-maintained roadways and absence of a general speed limit.

- **Schnellstraße**: This word refers to a fast road or expressway, mainly designed for motorized traffic.
- **Kraftfahrstraße**: A Kraftfahrstraße is a federal highway in Germany that is reserved for motor vehicles capable of exceeding 60 km/h (37 mph).

## Opposites

Although Autobahn is commonly associated with high-speed roads, there are a few terms that represent its opposite or a variation in terms of speed:

- **Landstraße**: This term refers to a country road or rural highway, which usually has a lower speed limit and passes through villages and towns, offering beautiful scenic views.
- **Stadtstraße**: Stadtstraße refers to a city street or an urban road, where a lower speed limit is enforced due to denser traffic and the presence of pedestrians and cyclists.

## Examples
