Schadenfreude is a German word that refers to the feeling of pleasure or enjoyment that one experiences when witnessing someone else's misfortune or suffering. This could be seen as a negative emotion, but it is all too human and can sometimes be a source of humor or justification.

**Definitions:** Schadenfreude can be defined as the feeling of satisfaction or delight at another's misfortune. It is a complex emotion that is often accompanied by guilt, as it can be seen as unkind or cruel. It is sometimes described as "taking pleasure in another's pain," but this does not fully capture the complexity and nuance of the emotion.

**Opposites:** The opposite of Schadenfreude could be empathy or compassion, which involve feeling and caring for others' suffering. It could also be considered the opposite of kindness or benevolence, which involve actively seeking to help others rather than taking joy in their suffering.

**Synonyms:** The English language does not have an exact translation of Schadenfreude, but similar words could be "gloating," "smugness," or even "satisfaction." The word is related to the concept of "epicaricacy" in English, which means taking pleasure in another's misfortune.

**Examples:** Examples of Schadenfreude could be found in many areas of life, from playground bullies who take joy in seeing others get hurt to adults who feel a sense of satisfaction when their enemies experience misfortune. It can also be seen in the media, where people may take delight in hearing about celebrities' or politicians' scandals or failures.

While Schadenfreude may seem like a negative emotion, it is a part of the human experience, and understanding it is an important part of understanding ourselves and each other.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
