## Definition:

Affe (noun) - The German word "Affe" translates to "monkey" in English. It refers to a member of the primate family, specifically the monkeys that belong to the suborder Haplorhini. Affe is used to describe any monkey species, including both large and small primates found in different parts of the world.

## Opposite:

The opposite of "Affe" is "Mensch" which means "human" in English. Humans differentiate themselves from monkeys due to their distinct physical and intellectual characteristics.

## Synonyms:

- Schimpanse (chimp)
- Gorilla (gorilla)
- Orang-Utan (orangutan)

## Examples:

1. Der Affe klettert geschickt auf den Bäumen. (The monkey skillfully climbs the trees.)

3. Der Karnevalsumzug hatte einen Affen als zusätzliche Attraktion. (The carnival parade had a monkey as an additional attraction.)

Please note that the word "Affe" can also be used metaphorically to describe someone who behaves in a foolish or silly manner.
