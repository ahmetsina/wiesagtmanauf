Geduld 

Definition:
Die Geduld - translated as "patience" in English - refers to the ability to wait calmly in difficult or challenging situations without becoming annoyed or frustrated. It is the power to endure discomfort, delay, or provocation without losing self-control or becoming impulsive. In a broader sense, it also implies the willingness to give time for things to happen or for desired results to be achieved.

Opposite:
The opposite of Geduld is Ungeduld, meaning "impatience." While Geduld denotes patience and calmness, Ungeduld describes the tendency to become easily frustrated or irritated when waiting for something or when things do not go as planned.

Synonyms:
Some synonyms for Geduld include Ausdauer (endurance), Ruhe (calm), Gelassenheit (serenity), and Beständigkeit (steadfastness).

Examples:

2. "Haben Sie Geduld, Ihr Wunsch wird bald erfüllt werden." (Have patience, your wish will be fulfilled soon.)
3. "Seine Geduld ist bewundernswert; selbst in den anspruchsvollsten Momenten bleibt er ruhig." (His patience is admirable; even in the most challenging moments, he remains calm.)
