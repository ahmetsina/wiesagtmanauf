## Definition

Eifersucht is a German word that translates to "jealousy" in English. It refers to a strong emotion characterized by possessiveness, suspicion, and a fear of losing someone's affection or attention to another person. It is often accompanied by feelings of insecurity and a desire to protect one's relationship.

## Opposite

The opposite of Eifersucht is "Vertrauen" which means "trust" in English. While jealousy is based on fear and doubt, trust is built on a solid foundation of confidence and certainty. Cultivating trust in a relationship can help alleviate feelings of jealousy and create a healthier and more secure connection.

## Synonyms
