## Definitions
**Fremdschämen** is a compound German word derived from "fremd" (foreign) and "schämen" (to be ashamed). It refers to the feeling of embarrassment or secondhand shame that one experiences on behalf of others. This peculiar emotion can arise when witnessing someone else's awkward or cringe-worthy behavior.

## Opposite
The opposite of *Fremdschämen* can be described as *Stolz* (pride) or *Selbstbewusstsein* (self-confidence). These emotions stand in contrast to the discomfort and shame associated with *Fremdschämen*, as they often indicate a positive sense of oneself and an absence of embarrassment for others.

## Synonyms
Some synonyms for *Fremdschämen* include:
- **Schadenfreude**: The feeling of pleasure derived from another person's misfortune. However, while both describe emotions related to others, *Fremdschämen* focuses on empathy and embarrassment, while *Schadenfreude* portrays a sense of enjoyment or satisfaction.
- **Peinlichkeit**: This term is used to describe situations that are embarrassing or awkward. While it is not an exact synonym for *Fremdschämen*, it shares a similar context of causing discomfort or shame.

## Examples
Here are a few examples of situations that might elicit the feeling of *Fremdschämen*:

1. *At a formal event*, you notice a guest who stands up to give a speech but unknowingly has their fly down. The audience collectively experiences *Fremdschämen*.
2. *Watching a talent show on TV*, a contestant sings off-key and messes up the lyrics. The viewers may cringe and feel *Fremdschämen* as they empathize with the embarrassment the contestant is likely experiencing.
3. *Observing a person make inappropriate comments* in a professional setting can cause others to feel *Fremdschämen* due to the discomfort and embarrassment arising from the situation.

It is interesting how *Fremdschämen* allows us to share in the emotions of others, experiencing their shame indirectly. This universal feeling reminds us of our capacity for empathy and understanding, as well as our own vulnerability in avoiding awkward situations.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Fremdschämen" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Fremdschämen%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
