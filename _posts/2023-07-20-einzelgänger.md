## Einzelgänger

Einzelgänger is a German noun that refers to a person who prefers to be alone or spends most of their time in solitude. This word is composed of two parts: Einzel, which means "single" or "individual," and Gänger, which can be translated as "walker" or "goer." Einzelgänger can refer to someone who actively chooses to be alone rather than mingling with others.

### Definitions:

1. A loner or a person who prefers to be alone.
2. An individual who enjoys their own company and tends to avoid social interactions.

### Synonyms:

- Einzelkind (only child)
- Einsiedler (hermit)
- Eigenbrötler (recluse)

### Opposites:

- Gesellig (sociable)
- Teamplayer (team player)
- Nachbar (neighbour)

### Examples:

1. "Timo has always been an Einzelgänger and enjoys spending his weekends hiking alone in the mountains."
2. "Although Sophia is quite sociable at work, she is an Einzelgänger when she's at home, preferring to read books in solitude."
3. "As an Einzelgänger, Peter often finds solace in nature, where he can enjoy the peacefulness away from the hustle and bustle of city life."

Remember, being an Einzelgänger is a personal preference, and it is important to respect and understand individuals who enjoy their own company.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Einzelgänger" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Einzelgänger%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
