Sonnenschein is a German word which directly translates to “sunshine”. It is a word used to describe the rays of the sun, especially on a clear day.

**Definition**
Sonnenschein is the warmth and the light that is given off by the sun. It is commonly associated with happiness, joy, and energy. It is a term often used in weather forecasts, especially during the summer months.
