### Definition  
Schadenfreude is a compound word in German, made up of "Schaden" meaning "damage" or "harm" and "Freude" meaning "joy" or "pleasure". Thus, Schadenfreude refers to the feeling of pleasure or enjoyment one derives from the misfortune or suffering of others. 

### Opposites  
The opposite of Schadenfreude would be empathizing with others' suffering and feeling sad or sympathetic instead of happy or amused. 

### Synonyms  
Synonyms for Schadenfreude include "satisfaction" and "glee", but these words don't carry the same negative connotation as Schadenfreude does. 

### Examples  
An example of Schadenfreude in action could be laughing at someone who slips on a banana peel, or feeling good about a co-worker not getting the promotion they were hoping for. However, it's important to note that perpetuating Schadenfreude can be harmful to both oneself and others. It's better to practice empathy and compassion, even when it's difficult.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
