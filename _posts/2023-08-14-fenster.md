## Definition

The random German word I have chosen is "Fenster," which translates to "window" in English. A window is an opening in a wall or a building that allows light to enter and people to see what is outside.

## Opposites

The opposite of a window is a "Wand" (wall). While a window provides access to the outside world and allows light to pass through, a wall acts as a barrier, separating different spaces and preventing visibility.

## Synonyms

Some common synonyms for "Fenster" include:

- "Glasöffnung" (glass opening)
- "Lichtschlitz" (light slit)
- "Öffnung zur Außenwelt" (opening to the outside world)

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how the word "Fenster" can be used in sentences:

- "Ich schaue aus dem Fenster und sehe den schönen Sonnenuntergang." (I look out of the window and see the beautiful sunset.)
- "Bitte schließe das Fenster, es zieht." (Please close the window, it's draughty.)
- "Das Fenster ist beschlagen, ich kann nichts erkennen." (The window is fogged up, I can't see anything.)

In summary, "Fenster" in German refers to a window, which is an opening in a building allowing light and visibility. It can be opposite to a wall, and synonyms for this word include various terms referring to a glass opening or a source of light.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Fenster" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Fenster%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
