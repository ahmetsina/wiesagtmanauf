Affenhitze is a German word that translates to "monkey heat" in English. It is typically used to describe extremely hot and humid weather conditions. Just like when monkeys are feeling hot, they might become agitated or restless, people tend to be irritable, impatient and uncomfortable during an affenhitze.

**Definitions**

The term "Affenhitze" is derived from the behavior of monkeys who become very restless and irritable in hot and humid conditions. When we describe the weather as Affenhitze, It means that it is incredibly hot and humid, making it almost unbearable to go outside or do anything.

**Synonyms**

There are several synonyms that can be used to describe Affenhitze, including:

- Hitzewelle - Heatwave
- Schwüle - Stifling heat
- Gluthitze - scorching heat

**Opposites**

The opposite of Affenhitze is a mild temperature, which is generally referred to as mildes Wetter. During mild weather, temperatures are neither too hot nor too cold, and the climate is comfortable to enjoy outdoor activities.
