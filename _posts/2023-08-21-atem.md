- **Ausatmen**: Exhaling or releasing a breath.

### Synonyms:

- **Hauch**: A light breath or gentle breeze.
- **Aushauch**: Exhalation or expelling of breath.

### Examples:

1. "Der alte Mann konnte kaum noch atmen." (The old man could hardly breathe anymore.)
2. "Nach dem Langstreckenlauf versuchte sie, wieder normal zu atmen." (After the long-distance run, she tried to breathe normally again.)
3. "Tief durchatmen und dann wieder loslegen!" (Take a deep breath and then start again!)

Remember, the breath is not only essential for our survival, but it can also be used as a method of relaxation and stress relief. Take a moment to focus on your breath and let the worries drift away.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Atem" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Atem%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
