**Schadenfreude**

Schadenfreude is a compound German word that literally translates to “harm-joy”. It is a feeling of pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others. This feeling may be considered morally wrong but it’s a common human experience. 

**Opposite of Schadenfreude**

While there isn’t necessarily an opposite word for Schadenfreude, “Mitleid” is the closest antonym in German. Mitleid means sympathy or pity felt for someone else. So, the antonym of Schadenfreude is another German term that expresses compassion or empathy for another’s misfortune.

**Examples of Schadenfreude**

Schadenfreude can be observed in everyday life, such as laughing at a co-worker’s public speaking errors or being happy when a rival sports team loses. Alternatively, a more subtle form of Schadenfreude might manifest when we feel glad that we missed out on something bad that happened to others. It's important to remember that experiencing Schadenfreude doesn't define you as a person, but can be a natural reaction to certain situations. 

Schadenfreude is a word that has no one English equivalent and yet captures an entire spectrum of emotions. It’s a reminder that sometimes the complexity of the human experience can be distilled down into one unique and contextually loaded word.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude " data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude %20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
