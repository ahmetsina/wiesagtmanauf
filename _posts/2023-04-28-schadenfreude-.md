**Schadenfreude**

Schadenfreude is a compound German word that literally translates to “harm-joy”. It is a feeling of pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others. This feeling may be considered morally wrong but it’s a common human experience. 

**Opposite of Schadenfreude**

While there isn’t necessarily an opposite word for Schadenfreude, “Mitleid” is the closest antonym in German. Mitleid means sympathy or pity felt for someone else. So, the antonym of Schadenfreude is another German term that expresses compassion or empathy for another’s misfortune.

**Examples of Schadenfreude**

Schadenfreude can be observed in everyday life, such as laughing at a co-worker’s public speaking errors or being happy when a rival sports team loses. Alternatively, a more subtle form of Schadenfreude might manifest when we feel glad that we missed out on something bad that happened to others. It's important to remember that experiencing Schadenfreude doesn't define you as a person, but can be a natural reaction to certain situations. 

Schadenfreude is a word that has no one English equivalent and yet captures an entire spectrum of emotions. It’s a reminder that sometimes the complexity of the human experience can be distilled down into one unique and contextually loaded word.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude " data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude %20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---

Schadenfreude is a German word that is quite difficult to translate into one single word, but it means taking pleasure in others’ misfortunes. The literal translation of the word would be "harm-joy."

**Defination**
Schadenfreude applies to a feeling of pleasure or happiness, particularly visceral in nature. That someone else has experienced or is experiencing misfortune, whether tangible or not.

**Opposite**
Looking at the extreme definition of Schadenfreude, it's not hard to come up with the opposite. That would be to derive happiness from someone else's success or the defeating of an enemy or opponent. 

**Synonyms**
The synonyms of Schadenfreude are words such as gloating, epicaricacy, malice, sadism. While these are not exact synonyms, they do relate to the idea of finding happiness in someone else's misfortune.

**Examples**
Examples of Schadenfreude could be laughing at the misfortune of someone who struggles with a simple task or enjoying a co-worker being reprimanded by the boss due to their mistake. It can also go so far as enjoying someone else's painful experience, such as being injured or going through a public embarrassment.

Schadenfreude is not a positive or healthy emotion, and it's not something to be encouraged. However, the word does reflect an all-too-common human experience that stems from feelings of insecurity, competition, and envy.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude " data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude %20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
