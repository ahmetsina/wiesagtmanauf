## Definition

Erlaubnis (noun) refers to the act of granting permission or authorization for someone to do something or go somewhere. It is derived from the German verb "erlauben," which means "to permit" or "to allow." Erlaubnis is a crucial aspect of interpersonal and societal interactions, as it establishes the boundaries and guidelines for conduct.

## Opposite

The opposite of Erlaubnis is Verbot (noun), which means "prohibition" or "forbidden." While Erlaubnis grants authorization, Verbot denies permission or forbids a certain action or behavior.

## Synonym

A synonym for Erlaubnis is Genehmigung, which also means "permission" or "authorization." Although these terms are often used interchangeably, Genehmigung carries a slightly formal connotation, often associated with official approvals or licenses.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of Erlaubnis being used in sentences:

1. "Kann ich bitte um Ihre Erlaubnis bitten, das Gebäude zu betreten?" (May I kindly request your permission to enter the building?)
2. "Ist es Ihnen erlaubt, während der Arbeitszeit persönliche Anrufe entgegenzunehmen?" (Are you allowed to take personal calls during working hours?)
3. "Die Eltern haben ihren Kindern die Erlaubnis gegeben, am Ausflug teilzunehmen." (The parents gave their children permission to join the excursion.)

Remember, obtaining Erlaubnis is a fundamental aspect of respecting rules and maintaining harmonious relationships in various contexts.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Erlaubnis" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Erlaubnis%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
