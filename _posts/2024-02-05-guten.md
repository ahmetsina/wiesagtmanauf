# Guten Tag

**Definition:** The German phrase "Guten Tag" is the standard way to say "Good day" or "Hello" in German. It is commonly used as a polite greeting when meeting someone or when entering a place.

**Opposite:** The opposite of "Guten Tag" can be considered as "Gute Nacht," which means "Good night." While "Guten Tag" is used to greet someone during the daytime, "Gute Nacht" is used to bid someone farewell or wish them a good night.

**Synonyms:** Some synonyms for "Guten Tag" include "Hallo" (Hello), "Grüß Gott" (Greetings to God), and "Servus" (Hi). These phrases can also be used as alternative ways to greet someone in different regions of Germany or among friends and family.

**Examples:**

1. "Guten Tag! Wie geht es Ihnen?" - "Good day! How are you?"
2. "Hallo! Ich wollte nur 'Guten Tag' sagen." - "Hello! I just wanted to say 'Good day/Hello'."
3. "Grüß Gott! Hätten Sie eine Minute Zeit?" - "Greetings! Do you have a minute?"

It's important to note that "Guten Tag" is a formal greeting and is generally used when addressing someone unfamiliar or in a professional setting. In more casual situations, people often use "Hallo" or "Servus" to greet each other. Keep in mind the context and relationship with the person you are speaking to, as it can influence the choice of greeting.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Guten" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Guten%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
