## Definition:
Schadenfreude is a German word that refers to the feeling of pleasure or satisfaction derived from the misfortune or suffering of others. It is a compound word formed by combining "Schaden," meaning harm or damage, and "Freude," meaning joy or pleasure.

## Opposite:
The opposite of Schadenfreude can be described as Mitgefühl, which translates to empathy or compassion. While Schadenfreude involves finding enjoyment in others' misery, Mitgefühl emphasizes understanding and sharing their pain.

## Synonyms:
Some synonyms for Schadenfreude include:

1. Sarkasmus (sarcasm) - the use of irony to mock or ridicule someone's misfortune.
2. Geladenheit (gloating) - taking excessive pleasure in others' misfortunes or inadequacies.
3. Befriedigung (satisfaction) - deriving a sense of fulfillment or contentment from witnessing someone else's failure or suffering.

## Examples:
Here are a few examples of situations where Schadenfreude may arise:

1. When someone you dislike fails to achieve their goals, you might feel a sense of Schadenfreude.
2. Watching a rival sports team lose can trigger Schadenfreude, especially if you have had a history of competition with that team.
3. If someone who has previously treated you poorly encounters an embarrassing situation, you may experience Schadenfreude as a form of payback.

It is important to note that while Schadenfreude may be a natural human emotion, it is generally considered unhealthy and can lead to negative feelings and relationships. It is essential to cultivate empathy and compassion towards others to foster a more positive and supportive environment.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
