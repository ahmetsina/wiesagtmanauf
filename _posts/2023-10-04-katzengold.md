**Katzengold**

*Definition*: Katzengold, in German, is a compound word derived from "Katze" (cat) and "Gold" (gold). It refers to a substance that appears to be precious or valuable at first glance, but is actually worthless or of little worth. In English, the equivalent term for Katzengold is "fool's gold."

*Opposite*: The opposite of Katzengold would be "echtes Gold" (real gold). While Katzengold is an imitation or fake, echtes Gold signifies the genuine and valuable precious metal.

*Synonyms*: Synonyms for Katzengold include "Narrengold" (fool's gold) and "Schwefelkies" (pyrite). These terms can be used interchangeably to describe the same worthless substance that resembles gold.

*Examples*: 
1. "Er dachte, er hätte echtes Gold gefunden, aber es entpuppte sich als Katzengold." (He thought he had found real gold, but it turned out to be fool's gold.)
2. "Vorsicht vor Angeboten, die zu gut klingen, um wahr zu sein, es könnte Katzengold sein." (Be cautious of deals that sound too good to be true, it could be fool's gold.)
3. "Die glänzende Substanz im Fluss entpuppte sich leider als Katzengold." (The shiny substance in the river unfortunately turned out to be fool's gold.)

Overall, Katzengold serves as a metaphor for something that initially appears valuable, but upon closer inspection, is revealed to be a disappointment or worthlessness. It reminds us to be wary of deceptive appearances and to seek out genuine, lasting value.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Katzengold" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Katzengold%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
