# Definition

Vogel [ˈfoːɡl̩] is a German noun that translates to "bird" in English. It refers to a warm-blooded vertebrate animal characterized by feathers, a beak, and the ability to fly. Birds have a unique respiratory system and lay hard-shelled eggs, distinguishing them from other animals. They are found on every continent and in various environments, including forests, deserts, and oceans.

### Opposite

The opposite of Vogel is "säugetier" (mammal), as mammals are a distinct group of animals that give birth to live young, possess mammary glands, and have hair or fur covering their bodies. While birds lay eggs, mammals nourish their offspring with milk produced by the mammary glands.

### Synonyms

Synonyms for Vogel include "Federkleidträger" (feathered creature), "Gefiederter" (one with feathers), and "Flugtier" (flying animal). These terms are often used interchangeably with Vogel to refer to the general category of birds.

### Examples

Here are some examples of different bird species:

1. Der Adler (eagle) - Known for its majestic appearance and powerful flight.
2. Die Eule (owl) - Associated with wisdom and known for its nocturnal habits.
3. Der Pinguin (penguin) - A flightless bird adapted to the cold climates of Antarctica.
4. Der Kolibri (hummingbird) - Known for its ability to hover in mid-air and its vibrant colors.

Birds play important ecological roles, such as pollination and insect control. They also serve as a source of inspiration for various cultural symbols and expressions.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Vogel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Vogel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
