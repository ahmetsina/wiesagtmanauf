## Definition
"Stern" is a German noun that translates to "star" in English. It refers to a luminous celestial body visible in the night sky. Stars are massive, hot, and mainly composed of hydrogen and helium. They emit light and heat energy due to nuclear reactions happening within their cores.

## Opposite
The opposite of "Stern" is "Erde" (Earth). While stars are huge balls of gas in space, Earth is the planet on which we reside.

## Synonyms
Some synonyms for "Stern" in German include "Astro" and "Himmelskörper." These terms are often used interchangeably when referring to stars.

## Examples
1. Gestern Nacht war der Himmel klar, und die Sterne leuchteten hell. (Last night, the sky was clear, and the stars were shining brightly.)
2. Die Astronauten bewunderten die Schönheit der Sterne vom Weltraum aus. (The astronauts admired the beauty of the stars from space.)

Remember, "Stern" can also be used metaphorically to refer to someone who is exceptionally talented or successful, just like a star shining in the sky.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Stern" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Stern%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
