#### Definition

Fahrrad is a German noun that refers to a bicycle. It is derived from the combination of the words "Fahren" (to drive) and "Rad" (wheel). A Fahrrad is a human-powered vehicle that consists of two wheels connected by a frame, pedals for propulsion, and handlebars for steering.

#### Opposite

The opposite of Fahrrad is Auto (car), which represents a motorized vehicle that relies on an engine rather than human power for propulsion. While both modes of transportation serve the purpose of commuting, their fundamental mechanics differ significantly.

#### Synonyms

Synonyms for Fahrrad include:

- Rad: This is a more colloquial term for bicycle, commonly used in everyday conversations.
- Drahtesel: A playful and informal term used to describe a bicycle, inspired by the idea that riding one can make you feel like you're straddling a wire donkey.

#### Examples

Here are a few examples of phrases incorporating Fahrrad:

1. "Ich fahre jeden Tag mit dem Fahrrad zur Arbeit." (I ride my bike to work every day.)
2. "Am Wochenende machen wir eine Fahrradtour durch den Park." (We are going for a bike ride through the park on the weekend.)
3. "Hast du einen Fahrradhelm?" (Do you have a bicycle helmet?)

Note: In German, it is common to capitalize all nouns, regardless of their position in a sentence. Therefore, Fahrrad should always be written with an uppercase 'F'.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Fahrrad" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Fahrrad%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
