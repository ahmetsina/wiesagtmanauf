**Fahrrad** [(Noun)] - A German word.

**Definition**: Fahrrad, translated as "bicycle" in English, refers to a vehicle consisting of two wheels, handlebars for steering, pedals for powering, and a frame. It is usually propelled by pedaling and is primarily used for transportation, exercise, and recreational purposes.

**Opposite**: The opposite of a Fahrrad is a "Motorrad" (motorcycle), which is a similar two-wheeled vehicle but powered by an engine rather than human force.

**Synonyms**: In German, "Fahrrad" can also be referred to as "Rad," "Zweirad," or "Velo." These terms are commonly used interchangeably with Fahrrad.

**Examples**:

1. "Ich fahre jeden Morgen mit dem Fahrrad zur Arbeit." (I ride my bicycle to work every morning.)
2. "Sie hat ein neues Fahrrad gekauft, um Radtouren zu unternehmen." (She bought a new bicycle to go on bike tours.)
3. "Das Fahrrad ist ein umweltfreundliches Fortbewegungsmittel." (The bicycle is an environmentally friendly means of transport.)

Fahrrad, with its basic design and numerous benefits, has become an integral part of German culture, offering a sustainable and efficient way of getting around.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query=""Fahrrad" " data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20"Fahrrad" %20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
