**Sonnenschein**

- Definition: Sonnenschein (noun) refers to the sunlight or sunshine, specifically the bright and warm rays of the sun. It represents the presence of sunlight and its positive effects on the environment, as well as the emotional experience of feeling warmth and light.

- Opposite: Regenwetter (noun), which means rainy weather, can be considered the opposite of Sonnenschein. While Sonnenschein represents a bright and sunny day, Regenwetter refers to a gloomy and rainy day when the sun is hidden behind clouds.

- Synonyms: Helligkeit (brightness), Sonnenlicht (sunlight), Strahlen (rays)

**Examples**:

1. Heute scheint die Sonne besonders intensiv. (Today, the sun is shining particularly intensely.)

3. Die Kinder spielen fröhlich im Sonnenschein. (The children are playing cheerfully in the sunshine.)

Sonnenschein is not only a word that describes the natural phenomenon of sunlight, but it also symbolizes positivity, warmth, and happiness. Its presence can significantly impact our mood and overall well-being.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Sonnenschein" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Sonnenschein%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
