## Definition
Herz is a German noun which translates to "heart" in English. It is an essential organ in the human body that pumps blood throughout the circulatory system. Metaphorically, it is often associated with emotions, affections, or the core of something.

## Opposites
- Kopf (head) - The opposite of Herz can be considered Kopf, representing the mind or intellect instead of emotions or sentiments.
- Gefühllosigkeit (insensibility) - A direct opposite of Herz is Gefühllosigkeit, meaning the absence or lack of emotions or warmth.

## Synonyms
- Seele (soul) - Synonymous with Herz, Seele represents the soul or innermost self. It signifies the emotional and spiritual aspect of a person.
- Zentrum (center) - In a figurative sense, Herz can also be replaced by Zentrum, which means center. As the heart is the core organ of the body, Zentrum symbolizes the essence or focal point of something.

## Examples

2. Sein gutes Herz war immer hilfsbereit. (His good heart was always helpful.)
3. Der Ort war das Herz des Dorfes. (The location was the heart of the village.)
