**Definition:**

Einsam is a German word that translates to "lonely" in English. It is used to describe a feeling of being alone, disconnected, or without companionship. This emotion can arise from physical isolation, emotional detachment, or a lack of social interaction.

**Opposite:**

The opposite of einsam is "gesellig," which means "sociable" or "gregarious." This term refers to individuals who enjoy the company of others, actively seek social interactions, and thrive in group settings. While einsam conveys a sense of solitude, gesellig suggests a preference for being surrounded by people.

**Synonyms:**

Some synonyms for einsam include:

1. Allein: This word signifies being alone or on one's own. It implies a physical separation from others and can also carry connotations of emotional solitude.

2. Verlassen: Verlassen means "deserted" or "abandoned." It goes beyond mere loneliness and suggests a feeling of being forsaken or left behind.

3. Einsiedlerisch: This term refers to a more extreme form of loneliness often associated with hermit-like behavior or a tendency to isolate oneself from society.

**Examples:**

1. Nach dem Umzug fühlte sich Emma in ihrem neuen Zuhause oft einsam. (After moving, Emma often felt lonely in her new home.)

2. Obwohl sie sich inmitten einer Menschenmenge befand, fühlte Sarah sich einsam. (Even though she was surrounded by a crowd, Sarah felt lonely.)

3. Der alte Mann war seit dem Tod seiner Frau sehr einsam. (The old man had been very lonely since his wife's death.)
