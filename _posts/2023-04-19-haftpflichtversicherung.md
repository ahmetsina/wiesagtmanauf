Haftpflichtversicherung is a German word that translates to "liability insurance" in English. It is a type of insurance policy that protects individuals or businesses from financial risk in case they cause damage or injury to another person or their property.

One opposite of Haftpflichtversicherung is Nothaftpflichtversicherung or emergency liability insurance. This type of insurance policy provides coverage in case you cause damage or injury to someone else, but do not have a regular liability insurance policy in place.

Synonyms for Haftpflichtversicherung include Schadensersatzversicherung (damage compensation insurance) and Haftpflichtkasse (liability fund).

Here's an example of how Haftpflichtversicherung works: Let's say you accidentally damage someone's car while driving. Without liability insurance, you would be responsible for paying for the repairs or replacement out of your own pocket. However, if you have Haftpflichtversicherung, your insurance company would cover the costs up to the limits of your policy.

Overall, Haftpflichtversicherung is an important type of insurance policy that helps protect individuals and businesses from financial losses due to accidents and other unexpected events.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Haftpflichtversicherung" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Haftpflichtversicherung%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
