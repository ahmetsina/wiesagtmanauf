## Definition

Kleid, substantivized from the verb "kleiden" (to dress or to clothe), refers to a type of clothing that covers the body from the neck to the waist or ankles, typically worn by women. It is often worn on formal or special occasions, as well as in everyday situations, depending on the style and design. 

## Opposite

The opposite of Kleid would be Hose (pants), as they represent the lower-body garment that covers the legs. While Kleid is generally associated with femininity, Hose is more commonly worn by both men and women.

## Synonym

The term synonym for Kleid is Gewand (garment), which emphasizes the broader concept of clothing. While Kleid specifically relates to a dress worn by women, Gewand can refer to any piece of clothing, including dresses.

## Examples

- "Sie hat ein wunderschönes rotes Kleid für ihren Abschlussball gekauft." (She bought a beautiful red dress for her prom.)
- "Das Abendkleid der Schauspielerin war mit Perlen bestickt und sehr elegant." (The actress' evening gown was embroidered with pearls and very elegant.)
- "Sie zog ein lockeres Kleid an, um sich an dem heißen Sommertag wohlzufühlen." (She put on a loose-fitting dress to feel comfortable on the hot summer day.)

Remember, a Kleid can come in various styles, lengths, and colors, allowing individuals to express their personal fashion preferences and showcase their unique sense of style.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Kleid" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Kleid%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
