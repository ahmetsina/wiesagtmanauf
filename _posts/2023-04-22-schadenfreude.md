**Schadenfreude** is a German word that describes the feeling of pleasure derived from the misfortune of others. It is a combination of "schaden", which means "damage" or "harm," and "freude," which means "joy" or "pleasure."

While Schadenfreude is technically a negative emotion, some psychologists argue that it can have positive effects. For example, laughing at a friend who trips and falls might relieve tension and bring people closer together.

**Opposites:** Although there is not a direct opposite for Schadenfreude, empathy can be said to be its antonym since it’s the act of understanding and sharing the feelings of another person.

**Synonyms:** Envy, spite, and malice can be related to Schadenfreude in some way. But each word has a different context.

Here are some examples of how Schadenfreude might be used in a sentence:

- I know it’s not right, but I couldn't help but feel Schadenfreude when I heard that my ex-boyfriend's new relationship had ended.
- She tried to hide her Schadenfreude when her rival stumbled on stage during the music competition.
- Although I wished her success, I couldn't help feeling a twinge of Schadenfreude when my colleague's long-awaited project was delayed.

Schadenfreude may be considered as a toxic emotion, but there are different ways to cope with it. Whenever you find yourself feeling it, try to look for the reasons that might cause you to feel that way and practice empathy.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---

Schadenfreude is a German word that has become quite popular in the English language in recent years. The literal translation is "harm-joy," meaning taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune or suffering. It is often considered a negative emotion, and some may even view it as a form of bullying or cruelty. 

The opposite of Schadenfreude would be empathy or sympathy, where one feels sadness or concern for someone else's misfortune rather than finding pleasure in it. 

There are many synonyms for Schadenfreude, including gloating, and delighting in someone else's pain or discomfort. Examples of Schadenfreude could be laughing at someone who trips and falls or taking pleasure in seeing a rival fail in a competition. 

However, it's important to remember that Schadenfreude is ultimately a harmful emotion and can have negative effects on our relationships and mental health. It's essential to cultivate empathy and compassion towards others rather than finding joy in their misfortune.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
