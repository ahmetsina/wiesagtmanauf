## Definition

Eis (pronounced "eyes") is a German word that means "ice" in English. It refers to the solid state of water, characterized by its low temperature and rigid structure. In Germany, Eis commonly refers to frozen water that is used as a treat or dessert, similar to ice cream.

## Opposite

The opposite of Eis is "Wasser" which means "water" in German. While Eis has a solid state, Wasser is the liquid form of water. When Eis melts, it turns into Wasser.

## Synonyms

- Gefrorenes Wasser (frozen water)
- Eiskristall (ice crystal)
- Firn (firn)

## Examples

- "Eine Kugel Schokoladeneis, bitte!" (One scoop of chocolate ice cream, please!)

Eis is a versatile word that can refer both to the frozen form of water and to a delicious treat enjoyed by many.
