Weihnachten is the German word for Christmas. It is a noun which is derived from the words "weihen" meaning to consecrate or sanctify, and "Nacht" which means night. In German, Christmas is celebrated on the 24th of December, which is known as Heiligabend (Holy Evening).

Some synonyms for Weihnachten include Heiligabend, Heiliger Abend,  and Christfest. Each of these words represents the same celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ.

Weihnachten is a joyful time in Germany, with many traditions and customs that have been passed down through generations. One of the most popular traditions is the Christmas market (Weihnachtsmarkt) which is held in every town and city across the country.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, the word unweihnachtlich (un-Christmas-like) is used to describe something that has nothing to do with the theme and tone of the holiday season. 

Some examples of how Weihnachten is used in context in sentences include: 
- Was schenkst du mir zu Weihnachten? (What are you giving me for Christmas?)
- Ich werde meine Familie an Weihnachten besuchen. (I will visit my family on Christmas.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Weihnachten" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Weihnachten%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
