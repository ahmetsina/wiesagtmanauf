## Definition

Garten is a German noun that translates to "garden" in English. It refers to a piece of land, typically located near a house, that is cultivated with plants, flowers, and sometimes used for recreational purposes. A garden is often adorned with various elements such as trees, shrubs, flowers, lawns, and paths, creating a tranquil and aesthetically pleasing outdoor space.

## Opposite

The opposite of Garten is "Wohnung" (Apartment). While a garden represents an outdoor space, an apartment refers to an indoor living space within a building. An apartment usually does not have its own garden but may have a balcony or access to shared communal spaces.

## Synonyms

Some synonyms for Garten in German include "Hof" (courtyard) and "Park" (park). While a Hof can refer to a small enclosed space within a building, a Park usually refers to a larger public green space with open areas, trees, and recreational facilities.
