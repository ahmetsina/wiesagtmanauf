Schadenfreude is a German word that describes the feeling of pleasure or joy that one experiences when witnessing the misfortune of others. It is a compound word composed of "Schaden" (harm or damage) and "Freude" (joy or pleasure). 

While it is a common human tendency to feel happy when others fail, the emotion of Schadenfreude is widely regarded as a negative and unhealthy emotion. It often reflects a lack of empathy and kindness, and can lead to a toxic and unhealthy social environment.

The opposite of Schadenfreude would be empathy, compassion, and kindness towards others. Rather than feeling joy at the misfortune of others, one would feel sadness and concern for their wellbeing. 

Synonyms for Schadenfreude include gloating, triumph, and malicious pleasure. Examples of Schadenfreude can be seen in situations of rivalry, jealousy, and competition, such as a sports team celebrating the loss of their opponents. 

It is important to recognize and avoid Schadenfreude, and instead cultivate empathy and kindness towards others. By doing so, we can create a more positive and healthy social environment.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
