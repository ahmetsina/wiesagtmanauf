Schadenfreude

Schadenfreude, pronounced as 'shah-den-froy-duh', is a German word that has gained popularity in various languages. It is derived from two German words: 'Schaden' meaning harm or damage, and 'Freude' meaning joy. When combined, Schadenfreude describes the pleasure or satisfaction that someone derives from witnessing the misfortune or suffering of others.

**Definition:**
Schadenfreude refers to the feeling of delight or happiness that arises when someone takes pleasure in the suffering or misfortune of another individual. It captures the notion of finding joy in the troubles or failures of others.

**Opposite:**
The opposite of Schadenfreude is 'Mitleid' which means empathy or compassion. Mitleid is the feeling of sadness or sympathy towards someone who is experiencing hardship or pain.

**Synonyms:**
- Gloating
- Sadistic pleasure
- Malicious delight
- Morbid satisfaction

**Examples:**
1. Despite their friendship, Lisa couldn't help but feel a twinge of Schadenfreude when she saw Rebecca failing her driving test.
2. The football fans erupted in Schadenfreude when the opposing team missed a penalty kick, leading to their failure.
3. Sarah's constant Schadenfreude towards her classmates' academic struggles only highlighted her lack of empathy.

It is important to note that while Schadenfreude may provide temporary satisfaction, it ultimately reflects a lack of empathy and compassion towards others.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
