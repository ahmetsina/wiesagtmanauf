Einsamkeit (noun) refers to the feeling of being alone or isolated. It often characterizes a state of solitude, where one may feel detached from others, both physically and emotionally. Einsamkeit can be experienced in various contexts, such as in social settings, relationships, or even within oneself.

Opposite: Geselligkeit (noun) - meaning sociability or companionship. It represents the opposite feeling of being alone, as it encompasses the enjoyment of social interactions and the company of others.

Synonyms: Alleinsein (noun) - which also denotes solitude or being alone. It emphasizes the absence of others rather than the emotional aspect of loneliness.

Examples:
1. Nach dem Umzug in eine neue Stadt empfand sie Einsamkeit, da sie niemanden kannte. (After moving to a new city, she felt loneliness as she didn’t know anyone.)
2. Der Schriftsteller zieht sich oft zurück, um in Einsamkeit zu schreiben. (The writer often retreats to be alone in order to write.)
3. Die Einsamkeit der Wüste kann zugleich inspirierend und beängstigend sein. (The solitude of the desert can be both inspiring and frightening.)

Understanding and acknowledging Einsamkeit is essential, as it allows individuals to address their need for connection, seek support, or develop strategies to overcome loneliness. It is important to remember that Einsamkeit is a common human experience, and reaching out to others and embracing Geselligkeit can help create a sense of belonging and emotional well-being.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Einsamkeit" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Einsamkeit%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---
