Kühlschrank (m) is a common German word that translates to "refrigerator" in English. It consists of two parts: "Kühl," meaning "cool," and "Schrank," meaning "cabinet" or "cupboard." The Kühlschrank, therefore, refers to a cooling cabinet used for storing food and drinks at a low temperature to prevent spoilage.

**Definitions:**
- A household appliance used for chilling and preserving perishable items.
- A temperature-controlled storage unit that helps maintain the freshness of food.
- A device with cooling technology that slows down bacterial growth.

**Opposites:**
- Gefrierschrank: A freezer that operates at even lower temperatures to freeze and store food items for extended periods.
- Zimmerwärme: Room temperature, the opposite of the cooling effect produced by a refrigerator.

**Synonyms:**
- Kühlsystem: Referring to the entire cooling system, including the refrigerator, compressor, and condenser.
- Kühlgerät: A more general term for any cooling device, including refrigerators, freezers, and air conditioners.

**Examples:**
1. "Bitte leg den Käse in den Kühlschrank, damit er frisch bleibt." (Please put the cheese in the refrigerator to keep it fresh.)
2. "Im Sommer ist es angenehm, kalte Getränke aus dem Kühlschrank zu genießen." (In summer, it is pleasant to enjoy cold drinks from the refrigerator.)

Knowing the German word "Kühlschrank" and its various aspects can be helpful for conversations about household appliances, food storage, and home organization.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Kühlschrank" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Kühlschrank%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
