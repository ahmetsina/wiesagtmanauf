Tausendfüßler, a compound German word consisting of Tausend (thousand) and Fuß (foot), refers to millipedes, an arthropod group with elongated bodies and numerous legs. They are commonly found in damp soil, rotting logs, and leaf litter.

The opposite of Tausendfüßler is Einzelfußler, referring to arthropods with a single pair of legs per body segment, such as centipedes. Despite the name Tausendfüßler, most species of millipedes do not have exactly one thousand legs.

Synonyms for Tausendfüßler include Hundertfüßler and Doppelfüßer. Some species of millipedes can secrete toxic and foul-smelling substances as a defense mechanism. For example, the species Glomeris marginata can release hydrogen cyanide when threatened.

Examples of Tausendfüßler species include the Black Portuguese millipede, which is an invasive species in several countries, and the Giant African millipede, which can grow up to 38.5 centimeters (15.2 inches) long. These species are often kept as pets or for educational purposes.

In conclusion, Tausendfüßler is a fascinating German word that represents a group of remarkable arthropods with long and numerous legs. While they may not have exactly one thousand legs, they have evolved to survive and thrive in various habitats throughout the world.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Tausendfüßler" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Tausendfüßler%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
