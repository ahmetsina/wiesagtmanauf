## Definition
Schadenfreude is a German word that refers to the feeling of pleasure derived from the misfortune or pain of others. It is a compound word, combining "Schaden," meaning harm or damage, and "Freude," meaning joy or delight. This word captures a complex emotion that is often considered unique to the German language.

## Opposite
The opposite of Schadenfreude would be "Mitgefühl" or compassion. While Schadenfreude stems from deriving joy from others' misfortune, Mitgefühl involves feeling empathy and understanding towards others' suffering. The contrast between these two words highlights the duality of human nature and the spectrum of emotions we can experience.

## Synonyms
Synonyms for Schadenfreude include "Scherzfreude" and "Hohnfreude." These words, although less commonly used, convey a similar notion of finding joy or amusement in the troubles of others. It's important to note that these synonyms carry varying degrees of negative connotation and are not as widely accepted or utilized.

## Examples
- Watching a rival sports team lose and feeling a sense of satisfaction
- Laughing at someone's embarrassing moment, such as slipping on a banana peel
- Feeling a surge of happiness when a coworker's project fails, out of jealousy
- Smirking at a celebrity's scandalous news and taking pleasure in their downfall

Overall, Schadenfreude is a complex emotion that highlights the intricate nature of human interactions. While it may bring temporary pleasure, it is essential to recognize the importance of empathy and compassion in fostering positive relationships with others.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
