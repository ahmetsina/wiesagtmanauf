## Definitions:
Die Kartoffel is a German word that translates to "potato" in English. It refers to a starchy, underground tuberous crop commonly eaten as a vegetable. Kartoffeln can be prepared in various ways, such as boiled, mashed, fried, or roasted.

## Opposites:
- Gemüse (vegetable): While potatoes are often categorized as vegetables in general, they can be considered the opposite of other greens and non-starchy vegetables like broccoli or spinach.
- Obst (fruit): While potatoes are not fruits, they can be seen as the opposite of fruits in terms of culinary categorization.

## Synonyms:
- Erdapfel: This is a colloquial synonym for Kartoffel in certain regions of German-speaking countries. It literally translates to "earth apple," illustrating the below-ground growth of potatoes.

## Examples:
1. *Die Kartoffeln müssen geschält werden, bevor sie gekocht werden.* (The potatoes need to be peeled before they are boiled.)
2. *Meine Mutter macht die besten Kartoffelpuffer.* (My mother makes the best potato pancakes.)
3. *Wir haben gestern Kartoffelsalat zum Abendessen gegessen.* (We had potato salad for dinner yesterday.)

Kartoffeln are highly versatile and commonly used in German cuisine. They can be a main component of a dish (such as potato soup) or serve as a side dish (like roasted potatoes). Whichever way they are prepared, Kartoffeln remain a staple food in many German households.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Kartoffel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Kartoffel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
