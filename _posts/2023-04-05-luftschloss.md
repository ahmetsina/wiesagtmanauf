Luftschloss is a German word that translates directly to "air castle" in English. It may seem a bit confusing at first, but the word actually has a few different meanings depending on the context in which it is used.

The primary definition of Luftschloss is a metaphorical one, referring to an imaginary or impractical idea or plan without any realistic basis. It can be used to describe someone who is daydreaming, fantasizing about unrealistic scenarios, or making plans that are unlikely to come to fruition.

Here's an example sentence using Luftschloss:

- "Jan is always dreaming up new business ideas, but they're just Luftschl√∂sser. He has no real plan to make them happen."

In addition to its figurative meaning, Luftschloss can also be used literally to describe a castle or palace that has been built for aesthetic purposes rather than for actual use. These kinds of castles were popular in the 19th century and were often admired purely for their beauty and extravagance.

Opposites of the word include "realistisch" (realistic) and "praktisch" (practical). Some synonyms for Luftschloss include "Trugbild" (mirage), "Hirngespinst" (brainchild), and "Phantasiegebilde" (fantasy creation).

In summary, while the German word Luftschloss may seem a bit strange at first glance, it has a few nuanced meanings that can be useful to know when speaking or writing in German. Whether it refers to an imaginary plan or an ornamental castle, this word is a great example of the creativity and diversity of the German language.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Luftschloss" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Luftschloss%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
