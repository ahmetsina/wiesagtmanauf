### Brot

**Definition:** Brot is the German word for bread, a staple food in many cultures around the world. It is typically made from flour, water, and yeast, and is often enjoyed as a breakfast or snack food.

**Opposite:** The opposite of Brot in German could be considered "Käse" which means cheese. While bread is a common food item, cheese is a dairy product that is often enjoyed with bread or on its own.

**Synonyms:** Some synonyms for Brot in German include "Laib" or "Wecken," which are both used to refer to different types of bread products.

**Examples:** 
- "Ich esse gerne frisches Brot zum Frühstück."
- "In Deutschland gibt es eine große Vielfalt an Brotsorten."
- "Ein gutes Brot sollte knusprig und saftig sein."\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Brot" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Brot%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
