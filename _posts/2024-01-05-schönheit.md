## Definition
Schönheit (feminine noun) is the German word for "beauty." It represents the quality or feature of being attractive, pleasing, or aesthetically pleasing to the senses. It encompasses both physical appearances and inner qualities.

## Opposite
The opposite of Schönheit is "Hässlichkeit," which means "ugliness" in English. Whereas Schönheit emphasizes qualities that are visually pleasing, Hässlichkeit denotes the absence or opposite of such qualities.

## Synonyms
- Anmut (grace)
- Attraktivität (attractiveness)
- Reiz (charm)
