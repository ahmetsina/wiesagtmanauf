## Definition
Bienenstich is a German word that literally translates to "bee sting" in English. However, it can also refer to a specific type of German cake, made of sweet yeast dough, a creamy filling, and a caramelized almond topping. 

The term Bienenstich is derived from the fact that bees were once attracted to the sweet almond topping of this cake, leading to stings. This cake is popular in Germany and is often enjoyed as a dessert or a sweet treat with coffee.

## Opposites
An opposite of Bienenstich, in terms of a cake, could be a savory dish such as a quiche or a sandwich. In terms of the literal translation "bee sting," an opposite could be a "mosquito bite" or any other non-stinging insect encounter.

## Synonyms
