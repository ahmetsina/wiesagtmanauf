## Autobahn

**Definition:** Autobahn is a German word that translates to "highway" or "motorway" in English. It is derived from "auto" (car) and "bahn" (path/track). Autobahns are major roadways in Germany that are renowned for their absence of general speed limits. 

**Opposite:** The opposite of Autobahn would be a "Landstraße" (country road) or a regular urban street, where speed limits are strictly enforced.

**Synonyms:** Autobahn is also referred to as "Kraftfahrstraße" or "Fernstraße" in German.

**Examples:** 
1. "Auf der Autobahn kann man oft die Geschwindigkeit genießen." (On the Autobahn, one can often enjoy high speeds.)
2. "Um zum Flughafen zu kommen, musst du die Autobahn nehmen." (To get to the airport, you must take the Autobahn.)
3. "Auf der Autobahn herrscht oft reges Verkehrsaufkommen." (There is often heavy traffic on the Autobahn.)

Autobahn is not only a word but also an integral part of German culture and transportation infrastructure. It symbolizes the efficiency and engineering prowess of Germany's road network.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Autobahn" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Autobahn%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
