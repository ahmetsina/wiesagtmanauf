Morgen

Definition: The German word "Morgen" translates to "morning" in English. It refers to the period of time between dawn and noon.

Opposite: The opposite of "Morgen" is "Abend," meaning "evening." While the morning represents the beginning of the day, the evening marks its end.

Synonyms: Some synonyms for "Morgen" include "Vormittag" (forenoon) and "Fr√ºhe" (early hours).

Examples:
1. Guten Morgen! - Good morning!
2. Ich stehe jeden Morgen um 6 Uhr auf. - I wake up at 6 am every morning.
3. Der Morgenhimmel war mit rosafarbenen Wolken bedeckt. - The morning sky was covered with pink clouds.

Note: "Morgen" can also be used to refer to the future, similar to the English word "tomorrow." In this context, it is written with a capital letter ("Morgen") to distinguish it from the time of day.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Morgen" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Morgen%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
