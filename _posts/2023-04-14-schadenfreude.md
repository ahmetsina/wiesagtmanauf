---

Schadenfreude is a German noun that describes the feeling of pleasure derived from someone else's misfortune. It is a compound word made up of the words "Schaden" (harm or damage) and "Freude" (joy). 

This emotion has no direct English equivalent and is often described as "malicious enjoyment" or "joy in the misfortune of others." While it is a common human emotion, it is generally not considered a positive one.

The opposite of Schadenfreude would be empathy or sympathy, where instead of taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune, one would try to understand and share their feelings.

Some synonyms for Schadenfreude in German include Mitleidlosigkeit (lack of compassion), Häme (malicious glee) and Spöttelndigkeit (mockery). 

Examples of Schadenfreude in action include laughing at someone who falls down, enjoying someone's public embarrassment, or taking pleasure in the failures of others. It can also be seen in situations of one-upmanship, where someone takes pleasure in showing off their superiority over others.

While it may bring temporary pleasure, indulging in Schadenfreude can have negative consequences on one's relationships and overall well-being. By recognizing and understanding this emotion, one can work towards overcoming it and promoting empathy and compassion towards others.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
