Fernweh is a German word that can be translated as "wanderlust" or "craving for travel." Unlike a simple desire to go on vacation, Fernweh refers to a deep longing for faraway places, an itch to explore the unknown.

One of the opposites of Fernweh is Heimweh (homesickness), which can be seen as the pull towards the familiar rather than the unknown. Another opposite could be Reisefrust (travel frustration), which describes the feeling of disappointment or disillusionment that can come with travel.

Synonyms for Fernweh might include Wanderlust (another German loanword that has come to be used in English), travel bug, adventure crave, or simply an itch to explore.

Examples of Fernweh might include that constant urge to book a plane ticket to a far-off land, or the feeling you get when you watch a movie set in a magical, foreign city and dream of walking its streets yourself. Fernweh can also be expressed in the desire to learn about other cultures, to try new foods and experiences, and to meet people from all over the world.

While Fernweh can be a powerful force that drives us towards new adventures and experiences, it can also be a reminder to appreciate the places we call home and the people we share them with.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Fernweh" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Fernweh%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
