## Definition

**Zeitgeist** is a German word that refers to the spirit of the time or the prevailing attitude or mood of a particular period. It is a combination of two words: "Zeit" meaning time, and "Geist" meaning spirit or mind. 

The term was first introduced by the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in his lectures on the philosophy of history, where he used it to describe the cultural, intellectual, and political climate of a specific era.
