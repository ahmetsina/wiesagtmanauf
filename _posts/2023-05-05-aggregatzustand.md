Aggregatzustand is a German word that refers to the physical state of matter. It is made up of two words, "Aggregat", which means aggregate, and "Zustand", which means state. In essence, Aggregatzustand describes the state that matter is in, whether it is solid, liquid, or gas. 

**Definitions**

Aggregatzustand is a term primarily used in physics and chemistry and refers to the physical state of matter. It is an attribute that describes the macroscopic properties of a system in terms of its position, velocity, and other dynamic variables. There are three main forms of Aggregatzustand, namely solids, liquids, and gases.

**Opposites**

The opposite of Aggregatzustand is Veränderung, which means change. It is because as we change the temperature or the pressure, the physical state of matter changes, and it moves from one Aggregatzustand to another. 

**Synonyms**

The synonyms of Aggregatzustand include:

- Zustandsform: literally means state form, which is another way of describing the different Aggregatzustands.
- Phasenübergang: refers to the changes of the state of matter between solid, liquid, and gaseous states.

**Examples**

Here are some examples of Aggregatzustand:

- Ice is the solid form of water.
- Water that flows in streams and rivers is the liquid form of water.
- Water vapor is the gaseous form of water.

In essence, Aggregatzustand is a word that describes the physical state of matter. It is an essential concept in physics and chemistry that can help us understand the macroscopic properties of different systems.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Aggregatzustand" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Aggregatzustand%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
