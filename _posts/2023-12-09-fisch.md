## Definition(s):

- Fisch is a masculine noun in German and refers to any creature that lives in water and has gills for obtaining oxygen. This includes species such as trout, salmon, pike, and herring.

## Opposites:

- Landtier (land animal): While Fish refers to creatures that live in water, Landtier refers to animals that live on land, such as lions, elephants, and monkeys.

## Synonyms:

- Aquatische Kreatur (aquatic creature): This term is often used as a synonym for Fisch to denote any living being that inhabits water.

## Examples:

- Der rote Fisch schwimmt schnell im Aquarium. (The red fish is swimming quickly in the aquarium.)
- In diesem Fluss gibt es viele verschiedene Arten von Fischen. (In this river, there are many different types of fish.)

Note: The German word "Fisch" can also be used to refer to fish as a food item, similar to the English word "fish." However, the post focuses on its definition as a living creature.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Fisch" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Fisch%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
