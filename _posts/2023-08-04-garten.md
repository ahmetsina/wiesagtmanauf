**Garten**

*Definition:* A Garten is a German word for "garden". It refers to a piece of land, usually next to a house, that is designed and cultivated for the purpose of growing plants, flowers, or vegetables. A Garten is typically an outdoor space used for recreational activities, socializing, or relaxation.

*Synonyms:* Synonyms for Garten include "Grünanlage" (green area), "Park" (park), or "Hof" (yard).

*Examples:*

2. "Unsere Familie trifft sich oft im Garten zum Grillen und Spielen." (Our family often gathers in the garden for barbecues and games.)
