Brombeere is a German word that translates to blackberry in English. The word is a combination of two German words 'Brom' that means prickly and 'Beere' meaning berry.

**Definitions**  
A blackberry is a small edible fruit produced by a brambly shrub that belongs to the rose family. The fruits have a deep purple to black color when ripe and are used to make jams, jellies, pies, crumbles, and other desserts. Fresh blackberries are also eaten raw, added to salads, or served with ice cream.

**Opposites**  
The opposite of the word Brombeere is "weiße Johannisbeere" which means "white currant" in English. This plant produces tiny white berries, which are not prickly like blackberries.

**Synonyms**  
Blackberries are also known as "Schwarzbeeren" in German. This term is more generic and includes other types of black berries like blueberries, raspberries, and mulberries.

**Examples**  
- Im Sommer pflücke ich gerne Brombeeren im Garten. (In summer, I like to pick blackberries in the garden.)
- Der Brombeer-Smoothie schmeckt köstlich. (The blackberry smoothie tastes delicious.)
- Ich habe in meinem Garten einen Brombeerstrauch gepflanzt. (I planted a blackberry bush in my garden.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Brombeere" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Brombeere%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
