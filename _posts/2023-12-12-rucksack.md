## Definition
**Rucksack** is a German word that refers to a backpack in English. It is derived from the combination of two words: "rücken" meaning "back" and "sack" meaning "bag." The term is commonly used to describe a bag that is worn on one's back, usually with two straps over the shoulders for support.

## Opposite
The opposite of a **Rucksack**, or backpack, would be a **Handtasche**, meaning "handbag" or "purse" in English. Unlike a backpack, a handbag is designed to be carried by hand or over the shoulder, often with a single strap.

- **Tornister**: Similar to the "Ranzen," the term "Tornister" is also used to describe a backpack primarily used by students.
- **Rückentasche**: This term is a combination of "rücken" (back) and "tasche" (bag), similar to "Rucksack." It is another word for backpack, albeit less commonly used.
