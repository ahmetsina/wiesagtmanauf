## Definition

"Gartenparty" is a German noun that translates to "garden party" in English. It refers to a social gathering or celebration that takes place in a garden or outdoor space. Gartenpartys are often organized during the summer months when the weather is pleasant, providing an ideal setting for people to mingle, relax, and enjoy each other's company.

## Opposite

The opposite of a Gartenparty would be an "Innenraumparty" or an indoor party. While both types of parties involve socializing with friends and family, an indoor party generally takes place within the confines of a house or other enclosed space. Indoor parties can be organized throughout the year, regardless of the weather conditions outside.

## Synonyms

Alternate terms for Gartenparty include "Hofparty" which means "courtyard party" and "Terrassenfest" which means "terrace party." These synonyms emphasize the specific location of the gathering while still conveying the concept of a social event held outdoors.

## Examples

1. Beispiel 1: 

    - Frau Weber organisierte eine extravagante Gartenparty, bei der hunderte Gäste zusammenkamen.

    (Translation: Mrs. Weber organized an extravagant garden party where hundreds of guests gathered.)

2. Beispiel 2:

    - Die alljährliche Gartenparty der Nachbarschaft findet am kommenden Samstag statt.

    (Translation: The annual neighborhood garden party will take place next Saturday.)

In conclusion, Gartenparty is a term used to describe a social event held in a garden or outdoor space, providing an opportunity for people to enjoy the outdoors and socialize with others. It is the antonym of an indoor party and can be referred to as a Hofparty or Terrassenfest in German.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Gartenparty" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Gartenparty%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
