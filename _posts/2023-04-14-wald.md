Wald is a German word that translates to "forest" in English. It refers to a large area of land covered with trees and other vegetation. The forest is a vital part of our eco-system, it provides us with oxygen, regulates our climate, purifies our water and ultimately supports all life on our planet.

Synonyms of Wald can be "Forst" which refers to a copse or small forested area, "Dickicht" which means thicket or dense forest, "Gewächs" which means growth or wildlife, "Wildnis" which means wilderness and "Jungwald" which means young forest.
