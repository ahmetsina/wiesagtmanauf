**Eichhörnchen** is a common German word used to refer to squirrels that are found in Europe, Asia, and North America. This word is derived from the German words "Eiche" meaning oak and "Hörnchen" meaning little horn or antler. 

**Definition:** Eichhörnchen refers to a small, furry animal with a long, bushy tail and is an arboreal member of the rodent family. They are generally found in forests, parks, and gardens.

**Synonyms:** Baumratte (tree rat), Kletterschwein (climbing pig), Baumstreifenhörnchen (tree-striped squirrel)

**Opposites:** Eichhörnchen is a specific type of animal from the rodent family, and therefore does not have a direct opposite. However, it can be compared to other animals in the same family such as rats, chipmunks or beavers.

**Examples:**

- Eichhörnchen lieben Nüsse. (Squirrels love nuts.)
- Schau mal, da ist ein Eichhörnchen auf dem Baum. (Look, there's a squirrel on the tree.)
- Das Eichhörnchen springt von Ast zu Ast. (The squirrel jumps from branch to branch.)
