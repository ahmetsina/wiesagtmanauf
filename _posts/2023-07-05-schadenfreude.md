## Definition
The German word "Schadenfreude" refers to the feeling of pleasure or joy that one experiences when witnessing the misfortune or suffering of others. It is a compound word derived from "Schaden" meaning damage or harm, and "Freude" which translates to joy or happiness.

## Opposite
While it is not a direct antonym, the opposite of Schadenfreude can be described as "Mitgefühl," which means empathy or compassion. Instead of deriving pleasure from others' misfortune, Mitgefühl entails understanding and sharing their pain or difficulties.

## Synonyms
Some synonyms for Schadenfreude include:
- "Scherzhaftigkeit" - playfulness
- "Harmlosigkeit" - harmlessness
- "Amüsement" - amusement

## Examples
1. Marc couldn't hide his Schadenfreude when his rival tripped and fell during the race.
2. Lisa felt a pang of Schadenfreude when she saw her annoying neighbor's car being towed away.
3. The internet is filled with memes and videos that showcase Schadenfreude, as people find amusement in the misfortunes of others.

It is important to note that while Schadenfreude exists in human nature, it is generally seen as negative and morally questionable. Cultivating empathy and genuine happiness for others' success is often a more preferable trait.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
