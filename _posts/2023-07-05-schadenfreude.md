## Definition
The German word "Schadenfreude" refers to the feeling of pleasure or joy that one experiences when witnessing the misfortune or suffering of others. It is a compound word derived from "Schaden" meaning damage or harm, and "Freude" which translates to joy or happiness.

## Opposite
While it is not a direct antonym, the opposite of Schadenfreude can be described as "Mitgefühl," which means empathy or compassion. Instead of deriving pleasure from others' misfortune, Mitgefühl entails understanding and sharing their pain or difficulties.

## Synonyms
Some synonyms for Schadenfreude include:
- "Scherzhaftigkeit" - playfulness
- "Harmlosigkeit" - harmlessness
- "Amüsement" - amusement

## Examples
1. Marc couldn't hide his Schadenfreude when his rival tripped and fell during the race.
2. Lisa felt a pang of Schadenfreude when she saw her annoying neighbor's car being towed away.
3. The internet is filled with memes and videos that showcase Schadenfreude, as people find amusement in the misfortunes of others.

It is important to note that while Schadenfreude exists in human nature, it is generally seen as negative and morally questionable. Cultivating empathy and genuine happiness for others' success is often a more preferable trait.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---

## Schadenfreude

**Definition:** Schadenfreude is a German word that is widely used to describe the pleasure or joy one derives from the misfortune or suffering of others. It combines the words "Schaden," meaning damage or harm, and "Freude," which translates to joy or pleasure. This term is often associated with a sense of malicious enjoyment experienced when witnessing someone else's failure or distress.

**Opposite:** The opposite of Schadenfreude can be described as "Mitempfinden," which translates to empathy. It refers to the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, particularly their pain or sorrow, instead of taking pleasure in it.

**Synonyms:** Although there is no exact one-to-one translation of Schadenfreude in other languages, similar concepts can be found. In English, expressions such as "glee at another's misfortune," "malicious joy," or even "taking delight in others' suffering" can capture the essence of Schadenfreude.

**Examples:**

1. *While watching a comedy show, Sarah couldn't help but feel Schadenfreude towards a character who slipped and fell.*
2. *Simon secretly experienced Schadenfreude when he saw his coworker's project fail, as it meant his own work would be more noticeable.*
3. *It is not a healthy trait to find Schadenfreude in the failures of your friends or loved ones, as it can strain relationships.*
4. *Some argue that social media platforms have created an environment conducive to Schadenfreude, as people can easily revel in the misfortunes of others from afar.*

Schadenfreude, although an intriguing word, promotes negativity and is generally considered an unsavory characteristic. It is important to cultivate empathy and compassion towards others, rather than deriving pleasure from their misfortunes.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
