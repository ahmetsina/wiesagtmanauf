The word "Apfel" in English means apple. It is a common fruit that is enjoyed by many people around the world due to its sweet and juicy taste. In German, "Apfel" can also mean courage, as in "Mutprobe machen", which translates to "make an Apfel test" - this means to take a daring challenge or a risk, which takes courage.

The opposite of Apfel is "Nicht-Apfel" which means "not an apple". Another opposite word is "Birne", which means "pear". However, these are not true antonyms of "Apfel" from a linguistic point of view.

Some synonyms of "Apfel" include "Edelapfel" or "Pfirsich", both of which refer to specific varieties of apples. "Kernobst" is another synonym that refers to all pitted fruits like apples, pears, etc.

Here are some examples of sentences where "Apfel" is used in German:

- Ich esse gerne Äpfel als Snack. (I like to eat apples as a snack.)
- Er hat einen großen Apfelbaum auf seinem Grundstück. (He has a large apple tree on his property.)
- Die Lehrerin sagte, dass ich Mut beweisen müsse und eine Apfelprobe machen sollte.
