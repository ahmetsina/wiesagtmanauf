## Definition
"Wandern" is a German verb that translates to "hiking" in English. It refers to the activity of walking or trekking in nature, typically for pleasure or exercise purposes.

## Opposites
- Bleiben (to stay): While "wandern" involves continuous movement, "bleiben" means to remain in one place.
- Ruhen (to rest): While hiking involves exertion and movement, "ruhen" means to take a break or relax.

## Synonyms
- Spazieren gehen (to take a walk): This is a more general term for walking, often in an urban or suburban setting. Unlike "wandern," it does not specifically imply hiking in nature.
- Bergsteigen (mountaineering): This term refers to climbing mountains and is a more intense form of hiking that involves technical skills and equipment.

## Examples
1. Wir möchten am Wochenende in den Schwarzwald wandern. (We want to go hiking in the Black Forest this weekend.)
2. Ich habe gestern einen schönen Wanderweg in den Alpen entdeckt. (Yesterday, I discovered a beautiful hiking trail in the Alps.)
3. Unsere Familie mag es, im Sommer in den Bergen zu wandern. (Our family enjoys hiking in the mountains during the summer.)
