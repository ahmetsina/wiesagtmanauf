Kühlschrank is a German word for refrigerator or fridge in English. It is a cooling appliance used for storing food and drinks at a low temperature to prevent spoilage. 

**Oppositites:** 
- Gefrierschrank (freezer)
- Warmhalten (keeping warm)

**Synonyms:**
- Kühler (cooler)
- Kühlbox (coolbox)

**Examples:**
1. Ich brauche Milch, aber sie steht im Kühlschrank. (I need milk but it's in the fridge.)
2. Wir haben einen neuen Kühlschrank gekauft. (We bought a new fridge.)

In Germany, it is typical to have a smaller refrigerator than in the United States. Therefore, Germans usually buy groceries more frequently and in smaller quantities to fit inside their fridge. It is also a common practice in Germany to turn off the fridge when leaving for an extended period, such as vacation. 

Kühlschrank is a useful tool for preserving food in German households and is essential in modern-day living.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Kühlschrank" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Kühlschrank%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
