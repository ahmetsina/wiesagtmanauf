## Definition
Eifersucht is a German word that translates to "jealousy" in English. It is a complex emotion characterized by intense feelings of possessiveness, envy, and insecurity in relation to a person, object, or situation. Eifersucht can occur in various contexts, such as romantic relationships, friendships, or even within families.

## Opposites
While the concept of Eifersucht revolves around possessiveness and envy, the opposite of this emotion is "Vertrauen" (trust) and "Freude für jemanden" (joy for someone). These opposing emotions involve feeling secure in oneself and being genuinely happy for the accomplishments or happiness of others, without any feelings of envy or possessiveness.

## Synonyms
There are several synonyms for Eifersucht that emphasize different aspects of the emotion:
- Misstrauen: This synonym primarily highlights the underlying sense of mistrust and suspicion that often accompanies jealousy.
- Neid: Neid refers to the feeling of envy specifically, without the possessiveness or insecurity associated with Eifersucht.
- Missgunst: Missgunst is another synonym for Eifersucht, focusing on the resentment or ill will felt towards someone due to their success or advantages.

## Examples
1. In a romantic relationship: Wenn mein Partner mit anderen Personen ausgeht, fühle ich Eifersucht. (When my partner goes out with other people, I feel jealousy.)
2. In a friendship: Ihre neue beste Freundin weckt meine Eifersucht. (Her new best friend triggers my jealousy.)
3. In a family: Die Eifersucht zwischen den Geschwistern ist oft ein Ergebnis der Aufmerksamkeitsverteilung. (Jealousy among siblings is often a result of attention distribution.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Eifersucht" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Eifersucht%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
