Sehnsucht, a word that represents a difficult to define emotion. It describes a feeling of longing, yearning, or romantic desire for someone or something that is absent, lost or cannot be attained. Synonyms for Sehnsucht include longing, craving, and yearning.

Sehnsucht is often used in a poignant, wistful sense, conveying the sense of a yearning that is so deep it cannot be described. It may take the form of nostalgia or a longing for a past time or place, or it may be a more general longing for something that is missing in one's life.

On the other hand, the opposite of Sehnsucht can be contentment, satisfaction, or fulfillment. When we have what we want, we feel complete and happy, and the feeling of Sehnsucht fades away.

Here are some examples of Sehnsucht:

- A German emigrant missing home and longing for the sights and sounds of their home country.
- Lovers separated by distance yearning to be together.
- Someone longing for a significant relationship.
- The feeling of nostalgia for a place or time that you can never return to.

In summary, Sehnsucht is a complex emotion that is difficult to interpret, but is often associated with a deep sense of longing or yearning for someone or something that is absent or cannot be attained.  So, it is a word which represents a lot of emotions inside our hearts.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Sehnsucht" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Sehnsucht%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---
