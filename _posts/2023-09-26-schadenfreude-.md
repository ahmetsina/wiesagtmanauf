## Definition
Schadenfreude is a German word that refers to the feeling of joy or satisfaction experienced when witnessing or hearing about the misfortune or suffering of others. It is a compound of two words, "Schaden" meaning harm or damage, and "Freude" meaning joy. While it is not exclusive to the German language, Schadenfreude has become widely known and recognized worldwide.

## Opposites
1. Mitgefühl (Compassion): The opposite of Schadenfreude, Mitgefühl represents a sense of understanding and empathy towards the suffering of others. It involves showing concern and a desire to alleviate someone's pain or difficulties, rather than deriving pleasure from them.

2. Empathie (Empathy): Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It involves putting oneself in someone's shoes and experiencing their emotions, rather than deriving satisfaction from their misfortune.

## Synonyms
1. "Gelächter über Leid" (Laughter at someone's suffering): This phrase directly translates to "Laughter at someone's suffering" and represents the concept of finding amusement or enjoyment in the misfortune of others.

2. "Freude am Unglück anderer" (Joy in the misfortune of others): This phrase conveys the same meaning as Schadenfreude and emphasizes the pleasure derived from witnessing or hearing about someone else's misfortune.
