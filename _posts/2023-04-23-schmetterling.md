Schmetterling is a German noun that refers to a butterfly. It is derived from the words 'schmetten' which means cream and 'ling' which means little, thus the word Schmetterling means 'little cream' due to the insects' love of nectar which could be seen as resembling cream.

Opposites of Schmetterling include Raupen, which means caterpillar, as this is the life stage the butterfly goes through before it emerges in its adult form. Synonyms of Schmetterling include Falter and Tagfalter which refer to butterflies that are active during the day.

Examples of Schmetterling in context could include phrases such as 'Der Schmetterling fliegt durch den Garten' which means 'the butterfly is flying through the garden' or 'Ich sah einen wundersch√∂nen Schmetterling im Park' which means 'I saw a beautiful butterfly in the park'. Schmetterling can be found in many different environments and is often considered a symbol of transformation and rebirth due to the metamorphosis process it undergoes.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schmetterling" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schmetterling%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
