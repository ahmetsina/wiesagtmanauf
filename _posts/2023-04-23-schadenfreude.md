**Schadenfreude** is a German word that can be translated into English as "harm-joy". It refers to the feeling of pleasure or amusement that one obtains from the misfortunes of others. 

One possible antonym of Schadenfreude could be "Mitleid" (compassion), which refers to the tendency to feel empathy or sadness for someone who is experiencing difficulties or hardships instead of finding pleasure in their suffering.

Some synonyms of Schadenfreude are "Scherzlust" (fun-loving), "Spottlust" (mocking), "Bösartigkeit" (malice), "Schadenlust" (harm-loving) and "Lästersucht" (gossiping).

For example, if someone is enjoying watching a video on YouTube of someone else's embarrassing moment, they are experiencing Schadenfreude. Similarly, when someone is laughing at someone else's failure, they are indulging in Schadenfreude. This is not a positive feeling and it is advisable to avoid harbouring Schadenfreude as it can lead to negative consequences in one's life.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
