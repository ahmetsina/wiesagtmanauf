## Definition

Eifersucht is a German word that translates to "jealousy" in English. It is derived from the words "Eifer" meaning "zeal" or "ardor" and "Sucht" meaning "addiction" or "compulsion". In German, Eifersucht generally refers to an emotion characterized by a feeling of intense possessiveness, insecurity, or fear of losing something or someone to a rival.

## Opposites

While opposites are not commonly associated with emotions, when considering Eifersucht, one could argue that trust or contentment may be considered opposites. Trust involves having faith in someone or something without experiencing jealousy or suspicion. Contentment reflects a state of satisfaction or fulfillment, devoid of the restless longing or envy associated with jealousy.

## Synonyms

There are several synonyms for Eifersucht that convey similar emotions or sentiments. Some common synonyms include:

- Neid (envy): A feeling of discontent or resentment towards someone else's possessions, qualities, or achievements.
- Misstrauen (mistrust): The lack of confidence or belief in someone or something, often associated with feelings of suspicion or doubt.
- Argwohn (suspicion): A feeling of distrust or wariness towards someone or something, often arising from a belief or suggestion of wrongdoing.
