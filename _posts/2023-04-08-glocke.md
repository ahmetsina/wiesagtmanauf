**Glocke** is a German noun which means *bell* in English. It is commonly used to describe a hollow instrument made of metal, which typically hangs in a church tower, and is used to sound out the hours of the day, indicate the start and end of religious services, or celebrate special events. However, the word *Glocke* can also be used in a figurative sense to describe other things that resemble a bell in shape or function. 

**Synonyms** of *Glocke* include *Klingel* (doorbell), *Schelle* (small bell), *Geläut* (peal of bells), and *Carillon* (musical instrument consisting of a set of bells). 

**Opposites** of *Glocke* include *Stille* (silence), *Ruhe* (quiet), and *Abwesenheit* (absence). These words are opposite to *Glocke* because they convey a lack of sound, whilst *Glocke* itself expresses the presence of loud, resonant noise. 

**Examples** of sentences using *Glocke*: 

- Die Glocke läutete um 12 Uhr mittags. (The bell rang at noon.)
- Die Kirche hat drei Glocken in ihrem Turm. (The church has three bells in its tower.)
- Wenn wir die Glocke hören, wissen wir, dass es Zeit ist zu gehen. (When we hear the bell, we know it's time to leave.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Glocke" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Glocke%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
