## Definition

Schadenfreude is a German word that has no direct translation in English. It is derived from the combination of "Schaden" (harm) and "Freude" (joy), literally meaning "harm-joy." Schadenfreude refers to the pleasure derived from observing the misfortune or suffering of others.

## Opposite

The opposite of Schadenfreude would be Mitgefühl, which translates to "empathy" or "compassion" in English. While Schadenfreude involves finding joy in another person's pain, Mitgefühl is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, particularly when they are going through hardship.

## Synonyms

Although there is no exact equivalent in other languages, certain terms come close to capturing the essence of Schadenfreude. These include:

- Epicaricacy (English)
- Joie maligne (French)
- Gloating (English)
- Malicious pleasure (English)

## Examples

1. While watching a reality TV show, Sarah experienced a sense of Schadenfreude when one of the contestants she disliked got eliminated from the competition.
2. Jack couldn't help but feel a tinge of Schadenfreude when he saw his co-worker spill coffee on his new white shirt, as he had always envied him.
3. Social media platforms sometimes become breeding grounds for Schadenfreude, as people take pleasure in publicly mocking and laughing at the failures or embarrassing moments of others.

Schadenfreude is a complex emotion that reflects a certain dark aspect of human nature. It is important to be aware of its presence and strive towards fostering empathy and compassion instead.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
