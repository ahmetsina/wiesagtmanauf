### Definition

Blitz is a German word that means "lightning" in English. It refers to the sudden flash of light caused by an electric discharge in the atmosphere during a thunderstorm. 

### Opposites

- Dunkelheit (darkness): While Blitz represents the bright and intense phenomenon of lightning, the opposite of light would be darkness.
- Stille (silence): Lightning is often accompanied by the loud rumble of thunder. In this context, silence can be viewed as the opposite of the thunderstorm experience associated with lightning.

### Synonyms

- Gewitterblitz (thunderbolt): This is a synonym for Blitz, emphasizing the combination of lightning and thunder.
- Blitzeinschlag (lightning strike): Refers specifically to the event when lightning directly hits the ground or an object.

### Examples

- "Der Blitz erhellte den Himmel w√§hrend des Sturms." (The lightning illuminated the sky during the storm.)
- "Es war nur ein kurzer Blitz, gefolgt von lautem Donner." (There was only a brief flash of lightning followed by loud thunder.)

Remember to always exercise caution during a thunderstorm and seek shelter indoors to stay safe from lightning strikes.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Blitz" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Blitz%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
