### Definition

**Übermorgen** is a German word that means "the day after tomorrow." It is used to refer to the day that occurs two days after the present day. This term is derived from the German words "über" (over, above) and "morgen" (morning/day).

### Opposite

The opposite of **übermorgen** is "vorgestern," which means "the day before yesterday." While übermorgen looks ahead to the future, vorgestern looks back to the past and refers to the day that occurred two days prior to the present day.

### Synonyms

- "Der Tag danach" (The day after)
- "In zwei Tagen" (In two days)
- "In 48 Stunden" (In 48 hours)

3. "Er hat übermorgen Geburtstag." (His birthday is the day after tomorrow.)
4. "Am übernächsten Dienstag ist der Kongress." (The conference is on the Tuesday after next.)

Remember to use **übermorgen** when referring to future events that occur two days from the present day.
