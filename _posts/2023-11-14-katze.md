**Katze**

- Definition: A "Katze" is a domesticated carnivorous mammal, commonly kept as a pet, known for its graceful movements, agility, and sharp retractable claws.

- Opposite: The opposite of "Katze" is "Hund" (dog) - while cats are known for their independence and agility, dogs are known for their loyalty and companionship.

- Synonyms: "Miezekatze" (colloquial term for a cat), "Stubentiger" (literally "parlor tiger" used to refer to indoor cats), "Samtpfote" (literally "velvet paw" emphasizing the softness of a cat's paws), "Schnurrer" (referring to a cat's purring).

- Example 1: Meine Katze liebt es, auf ihrem Kratzbaum zu klettern und mit dem Spielzeug zu spielen. (My cat loves climbing on her scratching post and playing with the toys.)

- Example 2: Wenn ich nach Hause komme, wartet meine Katze immer an der TÃ¼r und miaut laut, um meine Aufmerksamkeit zu erregen. (When I come home, my cat always waits at the door and meows loudly to get my attention.)

- Example 3: Katzen gelten als sehr reinliche Tiere und verbringen viel Zeit damit, ihr Fell zu putzen. (Cats are known to be very clean animals and spend a lot of time grooming their fur.)

Note: The word "Katze" in German can also refer to the coat color pattern known as "tabby" in English. In this context, it is used to describe the striped or spotted fur pattern that many cats have.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Katze" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Katze%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
