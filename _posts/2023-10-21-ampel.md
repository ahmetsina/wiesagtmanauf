## Ampel

Ampel is a German word that translates to "traffic light" in English. It is predominantly used to describe the signaling device used to control vehicular and pedestrian traffic at intersections. However, beyond its literal definition, Ampel has found its way into various idiomatic expressions and contexts.

### Definitions

- **Traffic light**: Ampel primarily refers to the red, yellow, and green signal lights used to regulate the flow of traffic at junctions and crossings.
- **Semaphore**: In a broader sense, Ampel also refers to the semaphore system used for distant signaling in transportation or communication.
- **Indicator**: Ampel could also be used to describe any kind of indicator or light that helps in decision making or signaling, such as indicator lights on machinery or electronic devices.

### Opposites and Synonyms

- **Opposite**: There is no direct opposite of Ampel, as it is a specific term. However, one could argue that the lack of any traffic light or signaling system would be the contrasting opposite.
- **Synonyms**: Some possible synonyms for Ampel include "Verkehrslicht" or "Verkehrssignal" (traffic signal) in a literal context. Figuratively, it could be synonymous with "semaphorisch" (semaphore-like) or "Lichtsignalanlage" (light signal system).

### Examples

- "Bitte warten Sie an der Ampel, bis die Fußgängerampel auf Grün schaltet." (Please wait at the traffic light until the pedestrian signal turns green.)
- "Der Zugverkehr wurde durch eine Ampel geregelt, um ein geordnetes Ein- und Aussteigen zu ermöglichen." (The train traffic was controlled by a semaphore system to facilitate orderly boarding and alighting.)
- "Die Ampel an meinem Computerbildschirm zeigt an, ob ich gerade online oder offline bin." (The indicator on my computer screen shows whether I am currently online or offline.)

As a fundamental element of road transportation, the Ampel plays a crucial role in maintaining safety and regulating traffic flow. Its presence has become ingrained in everyday life, making it an essential word in the German language.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Ampel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Ampel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
