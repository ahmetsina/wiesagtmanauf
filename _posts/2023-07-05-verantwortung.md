## Definitions

**Verantwortung** is a German word that translates to "responsibility" in English. It refers to the state or fact of being accountable or in charge of someone or something. Verantwortung involves taking ownership, making decisions, and accepting the consequences of one's actions. It is a fundamental aspect of personal and professional growth.

In broader contexts, Verantwortung can also imply obligations towards others, such as caring for someone's well-being, protecting the environment, or maintaining social order.

These terms indicate the absence of accountability, where individuals fail to acknowledge their obligations and disregard the potential impacts of their actions.
