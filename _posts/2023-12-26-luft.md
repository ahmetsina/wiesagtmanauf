## Definition

**Luft** is the German word for "air." It refers to the invisible mixture of gases that surrounds the Earth and is essential for the survival of all living beings. Luft is made up of primarily nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and traces of other gases. It provides oxygen for respiration, regulates temperature, and plays a crucial role in the water cycle.

## Opposite

The opposite of Luft is **Vakuum**, which means "vacuum" in English. While Luft denotes the presence of gases, Vakuum refers to a space entirely devoid of matter, including air. It is characterized by extremely low pressure and does not support human life as we know it.

## Synonyms

- **Atemluft**: This compound word translates to "breathable air" and specifically refers to the air we inhale and exhale during respiration.
- **Himmelsluft**: Literally translating to "sky air," this term is often used poetically to describe the purity and beauty of the air found high in the atmosphere.

## Examples

- "Der frische Wind strich sanft durch meine Haare, und ich atmete die reine Luft ein." (The fresh breeze gently swept through my hair, and I breathed in the clean air.)
- "Die Luft in den Bergen ist viel kühler und klarer als in der Stadt." (The air in the mountains is much cooler and clearer than in the city.)
- "Die Blumen blühen dank der fruchtbaren Luft in diesem Gebiet." (The flowers blossom thanks to the fertile air in this area.)

Remember to appreciate and protect the Luft around us, as it is vital for the well-being of all organisms on Earth.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Luft" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Luft%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
