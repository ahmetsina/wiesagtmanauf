Sonderangebot, a German word that means a special offer, is an extremely common term used in the retail industry to mark down prices on certain items for a limited period. This term is derived from two distinct words, "Sonder" which means special or distinctive, and "Angebot" meaning offer or proposal. 

The opposite of a Sonderangebot would be a Non-Special Offer or a regular price. When a product is not on a special offer, it is being sold at its regular price. 

Some synonyms of Sonderangebot in German include Sonderpreis (special price), Rabatt (discount), and Aktion (promotion). 

Here are some examples of how to use Sonderangebot in a sentence:

- Dieses Wochenende gibt es ein Sonderangebot auf B체cher. (This weekend, there's a special offer on books.)
- Der Supermarkt hat ein Sonderangebot f체r K채se. (The supermarket has a special offer for cheese.)
- Wir haben ein Sonderangebot f체r unsere Luxus-Wohnungen. (We have a special offer for our luxury apartments.)

Overall, Sonderangebot is an essential term in the German language, especially when it comes to shopping and retail. Knowing its meaning, opposite, and synonyms is crucial for both understanding and speaking German fluently.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Sonderangebot" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Sonderangebot%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
