## Gegenwind

Gegenwind (pronounced: geh-gen-veent) is a German noun that translates to "headwind" in English. It is a compound word formed by combining "gegen" meaning "against" and "Wind" which means "wind." The term has both literal and figurative meanings and is frequently used in various contexts.

### Definitions
- **Literal Definition**: Gegenwind refers to the wind blowing directly against the direction of movement. When traveling by air, land, or sea, if you are facing the wind, it is considered Gegenwind. This definition is commonly used in meteorological or navigational contexts.

- **Figurative Definition**: Gegenwind is also used figuratively to signify resistance or opposition in various aspects of life. It implies facing difficulties, obstacles, or challenges while pursuing a particular goal or endeavor.

### Opposites
- Rückenwind: This term is the opposite of Gegenwind, meaning "tailwind" in English. It refers to the wind blowing in the same direction as the movement. Rückenwind is beneficial for activities such as cycling, running, or sailing, as it aids progress instead of hindering it.

### Synonyms
- Widrigkeiten: This word is a synonym for Gegenwind in the figurative sense. It translates to "adversities" or "hardships" and denotes challenging circumstances or unfavorable conditions.

### Examples
- **Literal Usage**: Die Segler kämpften gegen den starken Gegenwind an, um die Küste zu erreichen. (The sailors battled against the strong headwind to reach the coast.)
