One of the most basic words in German is "Haus", which means "house" in English. This word can refer to any kind of building where people live or work, from a small cottage in the countryside to a massive skyscraper in a city.

As for its opposite, "Haus" stands in contrast to "draußen" (outside) or "außerhalb" (beyond). Synonyms for "Haus" include words like "Wohnung" (apartment), "Residenz" (residence), and "Zuhause" (home).

Here are some examples of how to use "Haus" in everyday German:

- Ich wohne in einem Haus. (I live in a house.)
- Das ist ein sehr großes Haus. (That is a very big house.)
- Mein Haus steht in der Stadt. (My house is in the city.) 

Overall, "Haus" is a practical and straightforward word that you'll encounter frequently in German-speaking countries. It's a great example of how mastering basic vocabulary can help you communicate effectively in a foreign language.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Haus" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Haus%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
