Friendship is a valuable connection that enriches our lives. It is known as "Freundschaft" in German.

**Definition**
Freundschaft is the deep and mutual bond that exists between individuals. It is characterized by trust, loyalty, and support. Friends are there for each other in times of both joy and sorrow.

**Opposites**
Although a strong and genuine friendship is usually marked by positive attributes, its opposite can be described as "Feindschaft" in German. Feindschaft represents enmity, animosity, or hostility between individuals.

**Synonyms**
Synonyms for Freundschaft include "Kameradschaft" (camaraderie) and "Miteinander" (togetherness). Both words emphasize the importance of unity and solidarity among friends.

**Examples**
1. "Wir haben eine langjährige Freundschaft, die Höhen und Tiefen überstanden hat." (We have a long-lasting friendship that has endured highs and lows.)
2. "In unserer Freundschaft können wir uns immer aufeinander verlassen." (In our friendship, we can always rely on each other.)
3. "Die Freundschaft zwischen den beiden Ländern ist stark und dauerhaft." (The friendship between the two countries is strong and lasting.)

Friendship is a fundamental aspect of human relationships, offering support, companionship, and shared experiences. Whether it's celebrating achievements or providing a shoulder to lean on during difficult times, true friendship is a treasure that transcends borders and languages.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Friendship" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Friendship%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
