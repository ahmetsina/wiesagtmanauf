### Definition:
Widerstand (noun) refers to the act of opposing or resisting something or someone. It can also denote the refusal to comply with certain demands, ideals, or authorities. The term is often used in the context of protests, revolutions, or civil disobedience against an established regime or oppressive system. Furthermore, Widerstand can also be understood as the physical or psychological force exerted in order to counteract an opposing force or obstacle.

### Opposites:
- Gehorsam (obedience): Unlike Widerstand, Gehorsam describes a state of submission or compliance with authority without resistance.
- Zustimmung (approval): While Widerstand signifies resistance, Zustimmung denotes agreement or consent.

### Synonyms:
- Protest: This term signifies a public expression of dissent or objection against a particular cause, policy, or action, often involving collective activities or demonstrations.
- Opposition: Similar to Widerstand, opposition refers to the act of opposing or combating a person, group, or idea, typically within a political or social context.
