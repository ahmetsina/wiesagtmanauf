*Gewitter* is a German noun that refers to a thunderstorm. Thunderstorms are a common occurrence in Germany during the summer months, particularly in the southern parts of the country. In general, a Gewitter is characterized by a violent storm with thunder and lightning, often accompanied by heavy rain and strong winds.

**Definitions**

- A Gewitter is a weather phenomenon that is caused by the interaction of warm and cold air masses. As the warm air rises, it cools and condenses, forming clouds. When the water droplets in these clouds become large enough, they fall to the ground as rain.
- A Gewitter is often associated with lightning, which is caused by the buildup of electrical charges in the atmosphere. Thunder is the sound that is produced by the rapid expansion of air around a lightning bolt.

**Synonyms**

- Unwetter
- Sturm
- Gewitterfront

**Opposites**

- Sonnenschein (sunshine)
- Wolkenlos (cloudless)

**Examples**

- Wir müssen das Picknick absagen, es gibt ein Gewitter. (We have to cancel the picnic, there is a thunderstorm.)
- Gestern gab es ein schweres Gewitter, das den Strom ausfallen ließ. (Yesterday there was a heavy thunderstorm that caused a power outage.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Gewitter" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Gewitter%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
