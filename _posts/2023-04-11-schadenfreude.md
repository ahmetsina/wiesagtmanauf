Schadenfreude is a German word that has made its way into English. It is an amalgamation of two German words, "Schaden" meaning harm or damage, and "Freude" meaning joy or pleasure. Schadenfreude can be defined as the pleasure one takes from the misfortunes of others. It is essentially the opposite of empathy.

Schadenfreude is a complex emotion and its origins are not entirely clear. Some psychologists have suggested that it is a natural human response to the failures of others, while others believe it stems from a deeper sense of insecurity and inferiority.

Opposites of Schadenfreude include empathy, compassion, and sympathy. Synonyms for Schadenfreude include gloating, delight, and satisfaction. 

Examples of Schadenfreude could include feeling pleasure at the downfall of a rival, enjoying the pain of an ex-partner who cheated on you, or finding humor in someone's embarrassing mistake.

While it can be tempting to indulge in Schadenfreude, it is important to recognize that it is not a healthy emotion. Schadenfreude can lead to a lack of empathy and a sense of disconnectedness from others. It is important to cultivate empathy and compassion for others, even when they experience misfortune.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
