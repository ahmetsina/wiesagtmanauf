## Definition
Sehnsucht is a German word that refers to a deep emotional longing or yearning for something or someone that is absent. It is a complex and profound feeling that combines both desire and sorrow. Sehnsucht encompasses a range of emotions such as nostalgia, wistfulness, and a sense of incompleteness or longing for something unattainable.

## Opposite
The opposite of Sehnsucht is Erfüllung, which means fulfillment or satisfaction. While Sehnsucht represents a yearning for something that is missing, Erfüllung denotes the state of being content and fulfilled with what one has or achieving a desired goal.

## Synonym
A synonym for Sehnsucht is Fernweh, which translates to "wanderlust" in English. Both words capture a strong desire to explore, discover, and experience something beyond one's current surroundings. While Sehnsucht focuses more on emotional longing, Fernweh expresses a craving for adventure and the unknown.

## Examples
1. As she watched the sunset over the horizon, a feeling of Sehnsucht washed over her, longing for the days gone by.
2. He felt a deep sense of Sehnsucht for his childhood home, reminiscing about the laughter and love that once filled its walls.
3. The poet's verses evoked a powerful Sehnsucht for a lover who had long since departed, conveying the intensity of his yearning.

Sehnsucht is a word that encapsulates the poignant human experience of longing for something or someone, often associated with a bittersweet nostalgia. It reflects the universal desire for connection, for the past, for faraway places, and for unfulfilled dreams.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Sehnsucht" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Sehnsucht%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
