**Schadenfreude**

**Definition:** Schadenfreude is a German word that literally translates to "damage-joy" or "harm-joy." It refers to the feeling of pleasure or satisfaction derived from someone else's misfortune or suffering. 

**Opposite:** The opposite of Schadenfreude can be described as empathy or compassion, where one feels sympathy towards others rather than deriving pleasure from their pain. 

**Synonyms:** Although there is no exact synonym for Schadenfreude, related terms include "gloating" or "taking delight" in someone else's misfortune.

**Examples:**

- When your friend spills coffee on their new shirt, and you can't help but feel a sense of Schadenfreude.
- Feeling a sense of satisfaction when an opponent in a game makes a mistake or loses.
- Laughing at someone's embarrassing moment, such as slipping and falling, and experiencing Schadenfreude.

It's important to note that while Schadenfreude is a common emotion, it is generally considered unhealthy and negative. Being able to genuinely share in others' joy and success is a more positive trait for maintaining healthy relationships and fostering a sense of community.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
