**Blitz (Lightning)**

- Definition: Blitz refers to a natural electrical discharge that occurs during a thunderstorm, typically appearing as a bright flash of light in the sky. It is commonly accompanied by thunder and occurs when the electrical potential difference between the ground and the atmosphere is too great to be contained.

- Opposite: The opposite of Blitz, in terms of weather phenomenon, would be "Stille" (Silence) as it represents the absence of thunderstorms and lightning.

- Synonyms: Some synonyms of Blitz include "Donnerblitz" (Thunderbolt) and "Gewitterblitz" (Thunderstorm lightning).

- Examples:
  1. "Der Blitz schlug in den Baum ein." (The lightning struck the tree.)
  2. "Der laute Donner folgte unmittelbar nach dem Blitz." (The loud thunder followed immediately after the lightning.)

Lightning is a captivating force of nature that can be both beautiful and dangerous. Its intense brightness and accompanying rumble of thunder often awe and inspire those who witness it.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Blitz" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Blitz%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
