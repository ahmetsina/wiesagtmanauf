One of the most complex and deeply ingrained concepts in modern German culture is "Vergangenheitsbewältigung". This compound noun has become a shorthand to describe the country's long and difficult process of coming to terms with its Nazi past.

The word itself is a combination of "Vergangenheit" (which means "past") and "Bewältigung" (which can be translated as "coping" or "management"). Together, they refer to the effort made by German society to acknowledge, understand and deal with the atrocities committed during the Holocaust and WWII.

In broader terms, "Vergangenheitsbewältigung" can also be used to describe any process of acknowledging and confronting past wrongs. It's a word that speaks to the complexity and difficulty of facing up to history, regardless of the context.

Opposite to "Vergangenheitsbewältigung" is the idea of "Vergangenheitsverdrängung" (suppressing or repressing the past), and can be seen in the way in which many Germans have tried to ignore their nation's complicated history with fascism and genocide.

Examples of "Vergangenheitsbewältigung" in Germany include the opening of museums and memorials, the teaching of WWII history in schools, and the establishment of institutions like the Federal Agency for Civic Education, which seeks to promote a more informed and engaged citizenry.

Overall, "Vergangenheitsbewältigung" is a word that speaks to the importance of confronting difficult histories, no matter how painful or uncomfortable. Only by acknowledging our past can we hope to create a better future.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Vergangenheitsbewältigung" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Vergangenheitsbewältigung%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
