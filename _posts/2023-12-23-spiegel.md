### Definitions
- A **Spiegel** refers to a reflective surface, typically made of glass with a metallic coating, that reflects light and produces an image of anything placed in front of it. Mirrors are commonly used for personal grooming, as decorative items, or for scientific and optical purposes.
- **Spiegel** can also be used metaphorically to describe something that reflects or represents the true nature of a person or situation. In this sense, it refers to a clear and accurate portrayal or representation.

### Opposites
- The opposite of a **Spiegel** is its absence, where there is no reflective surface available to produce an image.

### Synonyms
- **Spiegel** is synonymous with "Reflexionsfläche" (reflection surface) and "Spiegelfläche" (mirror surface).

### Examples
1. "Ich schaue mich jeden Morgen im **Spiegel** an, um mein Make-up aufzutragen." (I look at myself in the mirror every morning to apply my makeup.)
2. "Wir verwenden einen **Spiegel**, um Licht in den Raum zu reflektieren und ihn heller erscheinen zu lassen." (We use a mirror to reflect light into the room and make it appear brighter.)
3. "Sein Lächeln war der wahre **Spiegel** seiner Freude." (His smile was the true reflection of his happiness.)

Remember, a **Spiegel** not only provides a physical reflection but can also symbolize deeper meanings and representations.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Spiegel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Spiegel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
