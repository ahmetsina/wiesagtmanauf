Zeitgeist is a compound of two German words, Zeit (time) and Geist (spirit), which translates into English as "the spirit of the times". Zeitgeist refers to the intellectual, cultural and moral trends of a specific era or generation. 

Opposite of Zeitgeist can be jahrhundertgeist which means spirit of the century or the dominant trend of thought in a particular century.

Synonyms of Zeitgeist are "spirit of the age" and "spirit of the time".

An example of zeitgeist would be the popular trends of the 1960s, such as the hippie movement, folk music, and the rise of counterculture. These cultural phenomena reflect the attitudes, beliefs, and values of that particular era.

Understanding the Zeitgeist of a particular time and place can help provide insight into the mindset, values, and beliefs of that society. Furthermore, it can also shed light on how different cultures and generations have evolved over time.

Overall, Zeitgeist is an interesting and multifaceted word that describes the spirit of a specific moment in history. It is important to recognize and appreciate the Zeitgeist of different eras to appreciate the complexity of cultural and intellectual trends throughout history.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Zeitgeist" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Zeitgeist%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
