**Definition:**

Schadenfreude is a German word that describes the feeling of pleasure or satisfaction derived from the misfortune, harm, or failure of others. It stems from a combination of "Schaden" (damage, harm) and "Freude" (joy, pleasure). It refers to the somewhat malicious enjoyment one experiences when witnessing someone else's downfall or suffering.

**Synonyms:**

- Gloating
- Malicious joy
- Epicaricacy
- Joy at others' misfortune

**Antonyms:**

- Empathy
- Compassion
- Altruism
- Joy in others' success

**Examples:**

1. Despite being close friends, Sarah felt a strong sense of Schadenfreude when she found out that her colleague had been passed over for a promotion. She couldn't help but revel in his failure.

2. The audience erupted in laughter and Schadenfreude as the overly boastful magician's trick failed miserably on stage. His embarrassment only added to their enjoyment.

3. Social media often becomes a breeding ground for Schadenfreude, with users taking pleasure in others' public failures or embarrassing moments.

4. Lisa's constant Schadenfreude towards her younger sister's setbacks created a rift between them. The lack of support and empathy strained their relationship over time.

5. It is essential to overcome feelings of Schadenfreude and instead embrace empathy and genuine happiness for others' successes. By doing so, we create a more compassionate and positive environment for everyone.

Remember, while Schadenfreude may provide temporary amusement, it is important to cultivate empathy, compassion, and joy in others' achievements for a more harmonious society.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
