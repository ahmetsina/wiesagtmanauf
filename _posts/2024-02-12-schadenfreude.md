## Schadenfreude

Schadenfreude is a German word that describes the pleasure derived from the misfortune or suffering of others. It is a compound word, combining "Schaden" (damage) and "Freude" (joy). Though not directly translatable, it is often defined as the feeling of happiness or satisfaction one experiences when others face difficulties or failure. Schadenfreude can range from mild amusement at someone's minor mishap to intense delight in another person's major downfall.

### Definitions

- Pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others.
- Enjoyment felt at seeing the suffering or humiliation of others.
- A malicious delight in the misfortunes of others.

### Opposites

The concept of Schadenfreude does not have a direct opposite, as it represents a specific feeling based on others' misfortunes. However, empathy and compassion can be considered as contrasts to Schadenfreude. Instead of deriving pleasure from others' suffering, empathy enables individuals to understand and share the emotions of others, providing support and comfort instead.

### Synonyms

- Epicaricacy
- Gloating
- Malicious joy
- Sadistic enjoyment

### Examples

1. While watching a competitive sports event, Maria felt a twinge of Schadenfreude when her rival team's star player missed a crucial shot.

3. Tina's true character was revealed when she exhibited Schadenfreude upon learning that her ex-boyfriend's new relationship had ended abruptly.

It is important to acknowledge that while Schadenfreude is a common human emotion, it is generally considered negative and can be harmful to relationships.
