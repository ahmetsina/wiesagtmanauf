## Definition
"Eule" is the German word for "owl." It refers to a nocturnal bird of prey that is known for its large eyes, sharp beak, and ability to rotate its head almost 360 degrees. Eulen are widely recognized for their wisdom and association with nighttime activities.

## Opposites
While there might not be an exact opposite for the word "Eule," the counterpart of an owl could be a diurnal bird, such as a sparrow or a hawk. Unlike the owl, these diurnal birds are active during the day and rely on their keen eyesight to hunt.

## Synonyms
Synonyms for "Eule" include "Nachteule" and "Kauz." These terms are used colloquially to refer to someone who stays up late at night or prefers to be active during nocturnal hours, similar to the behavior of an owl.

## Examples
- Die Eule ist ein Symbol der Weisheit. (The owl is a symbol of wisdom.)
- Ich habe eine Eule im Garten gesehen. (I saw an owl in the garden.)
- Sie ist eine echte Nachteule und arbeitet oft bis sp√§t in die Nacht hinein. (She is a real night owl and often works late into the night.)

The word "Eule" encompasses not only the physical bird but also its symbolic significance in various contexts.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Eule" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Eule%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
