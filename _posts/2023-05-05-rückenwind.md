**Rückenwind** is a German word that translates to "tailwind". The word is composed of two parts: "Rücken" meaning "back" and "Wind" meaning "wind". 

**Definition**: Rückenwind is the wind that blows from behind an object or person. It is a favorable wind that provides a boost to anything that is moving forward.

**Opposite**: The opposite of Rückenwind is "Gegenwind", which means "headwind". Gegenwind is the wind that blows against an object or person moving forward, making it harder for them to move.

**Synonyms**: Some synonyms of Rückenwind in German are "Fahrtwind" and "Schubwind".

**Examples**:
- Wenn wir auf dem Fahrrad mit Rückenwind fahren, kommen wir viel schneller voran als mit Gegenwind.
    (*When we ride a bike with tailwind, we make much better progress than against the wind*) 
- Der Pilot sagte, dass das Flugzeug dank des Rückenwinds schneller fliegen würde.
(*The pilot said that the plane would fly faster thanks to the tailwind*) 
- Ohne Rückenwind wäre es sehr schwierig, das Segelboot zu steuern.
(*Without tailwind, it would be very difficult to steer the sailboat*)
