Definition: a deep yearning or longing for something or someone that is unreachable or far away.

Synonyms:
- Fernweh (wanderlust)
- Heimweh (homesickness)
- Verlangen (desire)

- Zufriedenheit (satisfaction)

Examples:

Sehnsucht is a powerful and complex emotion that often remains untranslatable in English. It encompasses a deep sense of longing, nostalgia, and homesickness. It can be directed towards a person, a place, or even an intangible idea. Sehnsucht is often associated with feelings of melancholy and the desire for something unattainable. It has inspired countless works of art, poetry, and music throughout history.

In contrast to Sehnsucht, Erfüllung represents the fulfillment or realization of one's desires and wishes. It signifies the completion of a longing, bringing a sense of contentment and satisfaction. Zufriedenheit, on the other hand, refers to overall satisfaction and the absence of longing or discontent.

Sehnsucht can be experienced in various aspects of life, such as romantic relationships, personal growth, and the desire for adventure. It can be both a source of inspiration and a poignant reminder of what is missing or distant. Regardless of its sometimes bittersweet nature, Sehnsucht provides a deeper understanding of the human experience and the complexities of our emotions.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Sehnsucht" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Sehnsucht%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
