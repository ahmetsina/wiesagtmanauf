## Definition

"Love" in German is **Liebe**. It is a noun derived from the Old High German word "lioba." Liebe primarily refers to a deep affection or strong feeling of emotional attachment towards someone or something. It encompasses a range of emotions, including tenderness, care, and warmth.

## Opposites

Opposite expressions of love in German include:
- **Hass** (hate)
- **Abneigung** (dislike)

While both "hate" and "dislike" represent antagonistic feelings, they are considered opposite to love due to their contrasting emotional intensity and nature.

## Synonyms

Synonyms for love in German are:
- **Zuneigung** (affection)
- **Hingabe** (devotion)
- **Verliebtheit** (infatuation)

These terms are often used interchangeably to describe the emotions associated with love, but they may vary in the specific connotations and contexts in which they are used.

## Examples

Here are some examples that illustrate the usage of the word "Liebe" in different contexts:

1. **Familienliebe:** Die Liebe zu meiner Familie ist grenzenlos. (Family love: The love for my family is boundless.)
2. **Liebe auf den ersten Blick:** Als ich sie das erste Mal sah, war es Liebe auf den ersten Blick. (Love at first sight: When I saw her for the first time, it was love at first sight.)
3. **Platonische Liebe:** Unsere Beziehung ist rein platonische Liebe, ohne romantische Absichten. (Platonic love: Our relationship is purely platonic love without any romantic intentions.)

It is important to note that love is a complex and multifaceted emotion, and its meaning can vary depending on individual experiences and cultural contexts.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Love" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Love%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
