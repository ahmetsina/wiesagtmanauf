# Baum

**Definition:** A "Baum" refers to a tree in German. It is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves.

**Opposite:** The opposite of "Baum" is "Holz" (wood), which represents the material derived from trees.

**Synonyms:** Alternative ways to refer to "Baum" include "Baumstamm" (tree trunk) and "Waldbaum" (forest tree).

**Examples:**

1. Der Baum steht im Garten. (The tree is in the garden.)
2. Diese Äpfel stammen von einem alten Baum. (These apples come from an old tree.)
3. Der Baum verliert im Herbst seine Blätter. (The tree loses its leaves in autumn.)

In German literature and folklore, trees are often depicted as symbols of strength, growth, and wisdom. They play a significant role in various folktales, where they are sometimes personified or believed to possess magical powers.
