Autobahn is a German word that translates to "motorway" or "highway" in English. The Autobahn is known for having no mandated speed limit, although specific sections of the road may have limits posted due to construction, congestion or environmental reasons. 

Opposite of Autobahn is "Landstraße", which is a rural road that usually passes through small towns and villages. Synonyms of Autobahn include "Autobahnausfahrt" which means "motorway exit" and "Autobahnraststätte" which means "motorway service area". 

There are many rules and regulations that drivers must follow when driving on the Autobahn, including driving on the right-hand side of the road, signaling when changing lanes, and maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front of them. 

Example sentence: "Ich fahre jeden Morgen auf der Autobahn zur Arbeit." (I drive on the motorway to work every morning.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Autobahn" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Autobahn%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
