Trinkgeld (noun) - [Synonyms: Bakschisch, Zimmermann] [Opposites: Abgabe, Berechnung]

Definition:
Trinkgeld, derived from the German words "trinken" (to drink) and "Geld" (money), refers to the extra sum of money given to a service provider as a token of gratitude or appreciation for their service. It is commonly translated as "tip" in English. 

Opposites:
1. Abgabe (noun) - [Synonyms: Geb√ºhr, Steuer] - The opposite of giving money voluntarily, Abgabe refers to mandatory payments or taxes levied by authorities or organizations.
2. Berechnung (noun) - [Synonyms: Kalkulation, Aufstellung] - Unlike Trinkgeld which is an additional amount, Berechnung refers to calculating or determining the precise amount owed for goods or services rendered.

Synonyms:
1. Bakschisch (noun) - [Synonyms: Schmiergeld, Bestechungsgeld] - In colloquial German, Bakschisch is another term used to describe a tip or bribe given for services rendered.
2. Zimmermann (noun) - [Synonyms: Zimmer, Kraft] - In certain regions of Germany, especially Bavaria, Zimmermann refers to a tip given to a waiter or waitress.

Examples:
1. In a restaurant setting, it is customary to leave a Trinkgeld of around 10% of the total bill amount to the waiter or waitress who provided excellent service.
2. A hairdresser who went above and beyond in styling your hair may deserve a generous Trinkgeld for their efforts.
3. When staying at a hotel, it is common to give a Trinkgeld to the housekeeping staff or concierge for their assistance during your stay.

Remember, Trinkgeld is not mandatory, but it is considered a gesture of appreciation for quality service.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Trinkgeld" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Trinkgeld%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
