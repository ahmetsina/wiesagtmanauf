**Sprachgefühl** is a German word that describes the ability to intuitively know what sounds right and what doesn't in a language. It is a combination of two words, "Sprache" meaning language and "Gefühl" meaning feeling. 

There is no direct translation for this word in English, but the concept is similar to what we would call "language intuition" or "language sensitivity." People with good Sprachgefühl have a natural ability to hear and use correct grammar, word order and pronunciation without having to study the rules extensively.

Opposites of Sprachgefühl could be "language disregard" or "language insensitivity." These are people who do not notice when a sentence is grammatically incorrect or if words are used in an odd way. 

Synonyms for Sprachgefühl include "language awareness" and "language instinct." These are other ways of describing the ability to sense and use language correctly. 

Examples of people with great Sprachgefühl would be multilingual people who can switch between languages without any errors, writers who have an excellent sense of style and tone, or actors who can speak with convincing accents. 

Improving your Sprachgefühl is possible through exposure to a language and consistent practice. Reading, writing and listening to native speakers are all great ways to develop your intuition for a language.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Sprachgefühl" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Sprachgefühl%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
