### Kuchen

**Definition:**
Kuchen is a German word that translates to "cake" in English. It refers to a sweet baked dessert typically made with flour, sugar, eggs, and butter, and is often topped with frosting or fruit.

**Opposite:**
The opposite of Kuchen would be "herzhaft" which means savory. Unlike Kuchen, savory dishes are not sweet and may include ingredients such as meat, cheese, or vegetables.

**Synonyms:**
Some synonyms for Kuchen include Torten (tart), Gebäck (pastry), and Plätzchen (cookie). These terms may be used interchangeably depending on the specific type of dessert being referred to.

**Examples:**
- Ein Stück Schokoladenkuchen, bitte. (A piece of chocolate cake, please.)
- Wir haben einen Kuchen zum Geburtstag gebacken. (We baked a cake for the birthday.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Kuchen" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Kuchen%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
