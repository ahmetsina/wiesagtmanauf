### Definition 
"Regenschirm" is a German word that refers to an umbrella, a portable and collapsible shade device. "Regen" means rain and "Schirm" means screen or barrier, so the word literally translates to "rain screen." It is a common household item in Germany, especially during the rainy season.

### Opposite 
The opposite of "Regenschirm" is "Sonnenschirm," which means sunshade or parasol. While an umbrella is used to protect from the rain, a parasol is used to protect from the sun. 

### Synonym
A synonym for "Regenschirm" is "Regenwiderstand," which means rain resistance. It is a technical term used mainly in the automotive and aviation industries to describe the ability of a vehicle or an aircraft to withstand rain.

### Example

(Translation: When it started to rain, she opened the umbrella and continued walking.)

"Die Sonne war zu stark, also nahm er den Sonnenschirm und stellte ihn auf."

(Translation: The sun was too strong, so he took the parasol and set it up.)

"Das Flugzeug hat einen hohen Regenwiderstand und kann auch bei starkem Regen fliegen."

(Translation: The airplane has a high rain resistance and can fly even in heavy rain.) 

Overall, "Regenschirm" is a versatile and useful word to know in German, especially if you plan on visiting the country during its rainy seasons or are interested in technical industries.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Regenschirm" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Regenschirm%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
