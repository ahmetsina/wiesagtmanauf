**Schmetterling** is a German word that means butterfly in English. It is derived from the German words "Schmetten" which means cream and "ling" which is a diminutive suffix. Thus, Schmetterling can be translated to mean "little creature that feeds on cream".

- **Definitions**:

A butterfly is an insect that belongs to the order Lepidoptera. It has four wings that are covered with scales, and its body is divided into three parts: head, thorax and abdomen. Butterflies are known for their colorful wings and their ability to fly.

- **Opposites**:

The opposite of a butterfly is a caterpillar. Caterpillars are the larval stage of butterflies and moths. They have a long, segmented body with six true legs and additional prolegs. Unlike butterflies, which have wings and can fly, caterpillars are wingless and move on multiple legs.

- **Synonyms**:

A synonym for a butterfly is "Falter" which also means flutter or flapping. Other synonyms include "Gaukler" which means juggler and "Luftakrobat" which means aerial acrobat.

- **Examples**:

1. Der Schmetterling fliegt von Blume zu Blume. (The butterfly flies from flower to flower.)
2. Die Kinder beobachteten die Schmetterlinge im Garten. (The children watched the butterflies in the garden.)
3. In der Nacht leuchtet der Schmetterling auf. (The butterfly shines at night.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schmetterling" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schmetterling%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
