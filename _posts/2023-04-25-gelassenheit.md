Gelassenheit is a German word which can be translated as "serenity", "calmness", or "tranquility". It is not just about being peaceful or still, but rather it is a state of inner peace and serenity that allows one to remain calm and composed even in the midst of chaos and turmoil. 

The opposite of Gelassenheit is likely anxiety, agitation, or restlessness. It’s difficult to hold both of these emotions at the same time. When you practice Gelassenheit, you mostly stay at a peaceful mental state.

Synonyms of Gelassenheit include calmness, equanimity, composure, poise, and grace. Each of these words represents a different angle on the same concept, but they all signify a sense of being in control of yourself in the face of external pressures.

For example, let's say you’re stuck in a traffic jam and your destination is within an hour, but there is no way that you could reach in that time. You can allow yourself to be consumed with anxiety and irritation, or you could practice Gelassenheit by paying attention to your breath, reminding yourself that you cannot control external circumstances, and focusing on something else entirely. 

In summary, Gelassenheit is an admirable state of being that allows individuals to stay calm and composed even in the most challenging of situations. Everyone can practice it with some effort, and it can help in being more productive, focused, and successful in life.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Gelassenheit" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Gelassenheit%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
