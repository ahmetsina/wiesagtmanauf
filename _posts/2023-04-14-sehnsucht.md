## Definition

Sehnsucht is a German word that describes a feeling of longing or yearning for something that is not present or easily attainable. It is often associated with a deep sense of nostalgia, homesickness or a strong desire for a person, place, or experience. Sehnsucht is a complex emotion that can be difficult to articulate in words, but it is a common theme in literature, music and art.

## Opposites

The opposite of Sehnsucht is often seen as contentment or satisfaction. When we feel fulfilled and happy with what we have, it is challenging to experience Sehnsucht. However, it is important to note that the two emotions do not cancel each other out or negate their existence. It is possible to feel both at the same time, especially when reflecting on certain memories or experiences.

## Synonyms

The synonyms of Sehnsucht include "nostalgia," "yearning," "longing," "craving," and "desire." All of these words capture the essence of Sehnsucht as an emotion that involves a deep and intense longing. Sehnsucht often goes beyond a superficial desire for something, and instead, embodies a more profound emotional experience.

## Examples

Examples of Sehnsucht can be found in literature, music or film. One well-known example is the works of Romantic poet, Heinrich Heine. His poetry often embodies themes related to longing, nostalgia and unrequited love. The song, "Ich Will," by Rammstein, is another example of Sehnsucht in music, where the speaker expresses a strong desire for something beyond their reach. In the film, "Lost in Translation," the two main characters experience a sense of Sehnsucht as they navigate their feelings of isolation and loneliness in Tokyo.

In conclusion, Sehnsucht is a complex and multifaceted emotion that captures the essence of longing, desire and nostalgia. It is an emotion with which we can all relate, and one that has inspired countless works of art and literature throughout history.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Sehnsucht" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Sehnsucht%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
