**Definition:**
Baum (noun) refers to a large perennial plant that has a self-supporting stem with branches and leaves. It is characterized by its woody structure and is typically taller, bigger, and long-lived compared to other plants. Trees provide shade, habitat for birds and animals, and play a crucial role in maintaining a balanced ecosystem.

**Opposites:**
The opposite of a Baum is "Strauch," which translates to shrub in English. While trees have a substantial stem and grow taller in size, shrubs are usually smaller in height and have multiple stems arising from their base.

**Synonyms:**
Synonyms for Baum include "Baumwuchs" (tree growth), "Forstbaum" (forest tree), or "Waldbaum" (woodland tree). These terms can be used interchangeably to refer to different species of trees found in various environments.

**Examples:**
- Die Eiche ist ein imposanter Baum. (The oak is an impressive tree.)
- Der Apfelbaum trägt jedes Jahr köstliche Früchte. (The apple tree bears delicious fruits every year.)
- Die Kiefer ist ein häufig anzutreffender Baum in Nadelwäldern. (The pine is a commonly found tree in coniferous forests.)
