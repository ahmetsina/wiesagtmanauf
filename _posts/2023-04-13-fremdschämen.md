Fremdschämen is a German compound word that translates to "external shame" or "vicarious embarrassment" in English. It is used to describe the act of feeling embarrassed on behalf of someone else who is unaware of their own embarrassing behavior. 

The opposite of fremdschämen is arguably schadenfreude, which refers to taking pleasure in another person's misfortune. 

Synonyms for fremdschämen include "cringe," "vicarious embarrassment," and "empathetic embarrassment." 

One example of fremdschämen is watching a friend give a lecture but they have their fly open or their shirt is on inside out. Another example is when a person makes a public scene or share too much information about their personal life on social media. 

Although fremdschämen may be considered a uniquely German concept, it is a feeling that can be recognized and experienced by anyone.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Fremdschämen" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Fremdschämen%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
