**Definition:** Wald is a German word for Forest. A Wald is an area of land that is covered with trees and can be either a commercial forest (a managed plantation grown specifically for the production of timber) or a natural forest (a forest that grows naturally on its own).

**Opposites:** The opposite of a Wald is a clearing or an open area. 

**Synonyms:** The German language has several synonyms for Wald. These include Forst (which is used more in the sense of "forestry," but can also mean "forest"), Gehölz (which is a smaller forest, sometimes even a grove), and Dickicht (which means "thicket" or "bramble").

**Example:** The Black Forest (Schwarzwald In German) is the largest forested mountain range in Germany. It is located in the southwest of Germany and covers an area of approximately 11,000 km². The forest is home to many species of wildlife, including deer, foxes, and wild boar. The area is also known for its picturesque landscapes, which attract millions of visitors each year.

Another example could be "Der Märchenwald" (The Fairy Tale Forest) which is a popular tourist attraction in Germany. It is a small forest near the town of Schönwald in the Black Forest region of Germany. The forest is filled with sculptures of characters from popular fairy tales, such as Cinderella, Rapunzel, and Snow White. The sculptures are made from wood and are placed along a winding trail through the forest.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Wald" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Wald%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
