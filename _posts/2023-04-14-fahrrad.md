Fahrrad is a German word for bicycle. It is derived from the two German words "Fahr" which means to ride, and "Rad" which means wheel. In Germany, bicycles are a popular mode of transportation due to their affordability and environmental-friendliness.

**Synonyms:** Rad, Zweirad

**Opposite:** Auto (car)

**Examples:**

- Ich fahre jeden Tag mit dem Fahrrad zur Arbeit. (I ride my bicycle to work every day.)

- Kann ich dein Fahrrad ausleihen? (Can I borrow your bicycle?)

- Meine Schwester hat sich ein neues Fahrrad gekauft. (My sister bought a new bicycle.)

In Germany, there are specific bike lanes on many roads and streets to ensure the safety of bicyclists. Additionally, there are many bike-sharing programs available, making it easy and convenient to rent a bike for short periods of time.

Overall, Fahrrad is an important part of German culture and a great way to stay active and enjoy the outdoors.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Fahrrad" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Fahrrad%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
