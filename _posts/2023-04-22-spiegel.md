**Definition:**

Spiegel is a German word that means "mirror" in English. It refers to a piece of glass or other material with a reflective surface that reflects images of objects in front of it.

**Opposite:**

The opposite of Spiegel is "Schatten" which means "shadow" in English. Unlike a mirror, a shadow is an area where light from a source is blocked by an object. It is a dark area that is created when an object comes in between a source of light and a surface.

**Synonym:**

One synonym of Spiegel is "Reflektor" which means "reflector" in English. A reflector is an object that reflects light or sound waves, just like a mirror reflects light waves.

**Examples:**

- Ich schaue mich selbst im Spiegel an. (I look at myself in the mirror.)
- Der Spiegel h√§ngt an der Wand. (The mirror is hanging on the wall.)
- Die Sonne scheint auf den Spiegel und reflektiert das Licht. (The sun shines on the mirror and reflects the light.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Spiegel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Spiegel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
