**Definition:**

Spiegel is a German word that means "mirror" in English. It refers to a piece of glass or other material with a reflective surface that reflects images of objects in front of it.

**Opposite:**

The opposite of Spiegel is "Schatten" which means "shadow" in English. Unlike a mirror, a shadow is an area where light from a source is blocked by an object. It is a dark area that is created when an object comes in between a source of light and a surface.

**Synonym:**

One synonym of Spiegel is "Reflektor" which means "reflector" in English. A reflector is an object that reflects light or sound waves, just like a mirror reflects light waves.

**Examples:**

- Ich schaue mich selbst im Spiegel an. (I look at myself in the mirror.)
- Der Spiegel h√§ngt an der Wand. (The mirror is hanging on the wall.)
- Die Sonne scheint auf den Spiegel und reflektiert das Licht. (The sun shines on the mirror and reflects the light.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Spiegel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Spiegel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---

Spiegel is a common German word that translates to "mirror" in English. It is derived from the Old High German "spiagal." 

### Definitions

A Spiegel is a smooth or polished reflecting surface, usually made of glass, that reflects images with a high degree of accuracy. It is commonly used for personal grooming, such as applying makeup or shaving. In physics, a mirror is a surface that reflects light in such a way that the reflected light preserves much or most of the detailed physical characteristics of the original light.

### Opposites

The opposite of a Spiegel could be anything that is not reflective, such as a wall or a piece of cloth. 

### Synonyms

In German, there are several synonyms for Spiegel, including "Reflexionsglas" and "Spiegelglas." 

### Examples

- Maria looked in the Spiegel to make sure her hair was styled correctly.
- Hans bought a new Spiegel for his bathroom to replace the old, cracked one.
- The physics teacher used a Spiegel to demonstrate the properties of light reflection. 

In conclusion, Spiegel is a useful and versatile German word that has many applications in everyday life and science. Regardless of how it is used or defined, it always refers to a reflective surface that helps us to see ourselves and the world in a new light.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Spiegel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Spiegel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
