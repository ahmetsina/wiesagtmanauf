Frühstück is a common German word that refers to the first meal of the day, often known as breakfast in English. It is a compound noun formed by combining the words "früh" meaning "early" and "Stück" meaning "piece" or "portion". Thus, the literal translation of Frühstück would be "early piece" or "early portion".

**Definitions:**

- Frühstück typically includes various food and beverage items like bread, rolls, cereals, butter, jam, honey, eggs, cold cuts, cheese, coffee, tea, and juice.
- It can also be used in a broader sense to describe the act of having breakfast.

**Opposites:**
- Spätmahlzeit (late meal): This term is used to describe meals consumed later in the day, such as brunch or lunch.

**Synonyms:**
- Morgenessen: This is another German word that can be used interchangeably with Frühstück.
