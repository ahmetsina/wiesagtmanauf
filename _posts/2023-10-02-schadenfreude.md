## Schadenfreude

**Definition:** Schadenfreude is a German word that refers to the feeling of joy or pleasure that one derives from another person's misfortune or pain. It is a compound word, combining "Schaden" (damage or harm) and "Freude" (joy or happiness).

**Opposite:** The opposite feeling of Schadenfreude is called "Mitgefühl" (compassion). Instead of deriving pleasure from someone's suffering, Mitgefühl involves feeling empathy and understanding towards others' pain or misfortune.

**Synonyms:** While there is no exact synonym for Schadenfreude in other languages, similar concepts exist. For example, in English, one might use phrases like "taking delight in someone's misery" or "finding joy in another's suffering" to convey a similar meaning.

**Examples:**

1. When Emma slipped and fell on the ice, some people couldn't help but experience a sense of Schadenfreude.
2. Despite the friendly rivalry, John secretly felt Schadenfreude when his soccer team's biggest rival lost the championship.
3. It is important to cultivate empathy and avoid indulging in Schadenfreude, as it can harm personal relationships and hinder personal growth.

Schadenfreude is a complex emotion that can reveal certain aspects of human psychology. While it may be tempting to feel pleasure when someone else fails or experiences hardship, fostering compassion and empathy is crucial for creating a supportive and caring society.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
