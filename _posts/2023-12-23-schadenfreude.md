## Definition

Schadenfreude is a German word that refers to the pleasure or joy one experiences when witnessing or hearing about someone else's misfortune. It is derived from two German words: "schaden," meaning harm or damage, and "freude," meaning joy or happiness. Schadenfreude can be seen as a complex emotional response that combines feelings of pleasure or amusement with a sense of superiority or satisfaction.

## Opposite

The opposite of Schadenfreude is Mitleid, which translates to sympathy or empathy. While Schadenfreude involves taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune, Mitleid focuses on understanding and sharing their pain or suffering. It is the capacity to be moved by the distress of others and offer support or kindness.

## Synonyms

There are no direct synonyms for Schadenfreude in German, but in English, similar concepts include "epicaricacy" and "gloating." These terms capture the idea of finding joy or amusement in another person's misfortune.

## Examples

- Laughing at someone who slips and falls while walking on ice. 
- Feeling satisfaction when a rival sports team loses an important game.
- Smiling at gossip about a coworker's embarrassing moment.

It's important to remember that Schadenfreude is generally considered a negative emotion, as it involves deriving pleasure from the suffering of others. While fleeting moments of Schadenfreude may occur naturally, it is crucial to cultivate empathy and compassion for others in order to foster a more positive and supportive society.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
