Scheinheilig is a German word that translates to "hypocritical" in English. It is made up of two components: "Schein" meaning "appearance" or "pretence", and "heilig" meaning "sacred" or "holy". The word is used to describe someone who pretends to have certain values or beliefs, while their actions indicate otherwise.

Some synonyms for Scheinheilig include doppelzüngig (double-tongued), heuchlerisch (hypocritical), and falsch (false). Opposites of this word include aufrichtig (sincere), ehrlich (honest), and transparent (transparent). Here are a few examples of how Scheinheilig can be used in context:

- "Seine Aussagen sind scheinheilig, er handelt stets entgegengesetzt." (His statements are hypocritical, he always acts in the opposite way.)
- "Sie prangert die Korruption in der Politik an, aber sie selbst ist scheinheilig und nimmt Bestechungsgelder an." (She denounces corruption in politics, but she herself is hypocritical and accepts bribes.)
- "Man sollte sich von scheinheiligen Menschen fernhalten, sie sind unehrlich und unzuverlässig." (One should stay away from hypocritical people, as they are dishonest and unreliable.)

Overall, the word Scheinheilig has a negative connotation, as it describes a character trait that is generally looked down upon in society. However, it serves as an important reminder to stay true to one's beliefs and values, and not to engage in behavior that contradicts them.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Scheinheilig" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Scheinheilig%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
