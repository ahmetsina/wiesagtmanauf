Fahrrad is a German noun that refers to a bicycle. Bicycles have been an integral part of German transportation for over a century. The word "Fahrrad" is a combination of the words "Fahren" (to ride) and "Rad" (wheel). 

**Definition**

A Fahrrad is a vehicle with two wheels that are usually of the same size. It is powered by human pedaling. Bicycles are used for various purposes, including transportation, exercise, and leisure activities.

**Synonyms**

In German, a bicycle can also be referred to as "Rad," "Fahrrad," or "Drahtesel."

**Opposites**

The opposite of Fahrrad is a motor vehicle, which uses an engine for power instead of human pedaling.
