*Apfel* is a German noun used to describe the fruit of the apple tree. This fruit is also characterized by its red or green skin, juicy flesh and a core with seeds inside. 

**Definitions:** Apart from being a fruit, *Apfel* is also a term used in a few idioms in German. For example, *das ist nicht vom Apfel gefallen* (this is not fallen from the apple) which means that something is not an accident that happened randomly. Another example is *jemanden vom Apfel abbeißen* (to bite someone off the apple), referring to persuading or convincing someone to do something they initially did not want to do.

**Opposites:** One possible opposite of *Apfel* can be *Birne* (pear), which is another fruit with a similar shape and texture. Also, a term like *Steinfrucht* (stone fruit) can be an opposite because it refers to a category of fruits that contain a pit or stone inside, like peaches or plums.

**Synonyms:** There are some regional synonyms for *Apfel* in German dialects or archaic words, like *Abbel* in Franconian or *Pomme* in some Swiss dialects. Also, there are some specific terms used to describe types of apples, such as *Granny Smith* or *Pink Lady.*

**Examples:** In German, *Apfel* can be used in different contexts, such as cooking recipes, supermarket advertisements, or just everyday conversations about food or health. For instance, *Apfelsaft* (apple juice) is one common drink in many German households, and *Apfelkuchen* (apple cake) is a popular dessert in many regions. Also, you can hear phrases like *5 Portionen Obst und Gemüse am Tag, mindestens ein Apfel dabei* (5 portions of fruits and vegetables a day, at least one apple included), which is a healthy recommendation for a balanced diet.

Overall, *Apfel* is a versatile word that not only describes a fruit but also conveys some idiomatic expressions and cultural associations in German.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Apfel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Apfel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---
