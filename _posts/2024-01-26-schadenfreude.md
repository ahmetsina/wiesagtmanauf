### Definition:

Schadenfreude is a German word that refers to the pleasure or satisfaction derived from someone else's misfortune or suffering. It is a compound word, combining "Schaden" (meaning harm or damage) and "Freude" (meaning joy or happiness).

### Opposite:

The opposite of Schadenfreude would be empathy or compassion, where individuals feel for the pain or difficulties faced by others. Schadenfreude, on the other hand, is characterized by the absence of emotions of sympathy or empathy towards others.

### Synonyms:

There are no direct synonyms for Schadenfreude in the German language. However, similar concepts can be expressed using other terms such as "Sadismus" (sadism) or "Schauderlust" (thrill-seeking from unpleasant events).

### Examples:

1. While watching a comedy show, Maria couldn't help but experience Schadenfreude when the main character tripped and fell on stage.
2. Kevin felt a moment of Schadenfreude when he saw his rival's car break down on the way to an important meeting.
3. The tabloid newspaper thrived on publishing scandals, catering to readers who enjoyed Schadenfreude.
4. Clara's roommate secretly felt Schadenfreude when Clara's expensive cake, which she boasted about, ended up tasting terrible.

In conclusion, Schadenfreude is a German word that describes the pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others. Although it is a natural human tendency, it is important to show empathy and compassion towards others, rather than finding joy in their suffering.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
