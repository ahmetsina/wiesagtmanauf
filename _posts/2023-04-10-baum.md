Baum is a German word that means ‘tree’ in English. This word refers to a tall perennial plant with a single stem or trunk, bearing branches and leaves. In German, Baum is the common term used for any type of tree, whether it’s a deciduous tree or a coniferous tree. 

Some synonyms for Baum include Wald (forest), Holz (wood), and Strauch (shrub). However, these words are not interchangeable as they refer to different types of trees and plants.
