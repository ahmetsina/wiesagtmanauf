## Definition
Bienenstock refers to a beehive in German. It represents the dwelling or shelter of a honey bee colony, usually made of wood or straw. The purpose of the Bienenstock is to provide a safe and functional space for bees to live, produce honey, and raise their young.

## Opposite
The opposite of Bienenstock would be "Honigwabe," which translates to honeycomb. While Bienenstock refers to the overall beehive structure, Honigwabe specifically represents the hexagonal cell framework where bees store their honey and raise their larvae.

## Synonyms
Synonyms for Bienenstock include "Bienenhaus" (bee house) and "Bienenzucht" (beekeeping). These terms are often used interchangeably to express the concept of a beehive or an area dedicated to housing bee colonies for honey production and pollination purposes.

## Examples
1. Die Imkerin besuchte ihr Bienenvolk und überprüfte den Bienenstock auf Anzeichen von Krankheiten. (The beekeeper visited her bee colony and inspected the beehive for any signs of diseases.)
2. Die Bienen waren fleißig und füllten den Bienenstock mit süßem Honig. (The bees were busy and filled the beehive with delicious honey.)
3. Der Imker benutzte einen Smoker, um die Bienen zu beruhigen, bevor er den Bienenstock öffnete. (The beekeeper used a smoker to calm the bees before opening the beehive.)

Remember to have caution and proper beekeeping knowledge before approaching or interacting with a Bienenstock to ensure the safety of both bees and humans.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Bienenstock" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Bienenstock%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
