**Autobahn**

**Definition:** The Autobahn is the German term for a motorway or freeway. It refers to the German national highway system known for its high speed limits, usually ranging from 120 to 130 km/h. The Autobahn is famous worldwide for its lack of a general speed limit on certain sections.

**Synonyms:** 

1. Schnellstraße (expressway)
2. Kraftfahrstraße (motor road)
3. Fernstraße (long-distance road)

**Opposites:**

1. Landstraße (country road): These roads have lower speed limits and generally pass through rural areas, connecting smaller towns and villages.
2. Bundesstraße (federal highway): These secondary highways in Germany connect towns and cities, often running parallel to Autobahns. They may have lower speed limits and more frequent intersections.

**Examples:** 

1. "Auf der Autobahn kann man meistens sehr schnell fahren." (On the Autobahn, you can usually drive very fast.)
2. "Die Autobahn A7 führt von Flensburg im Norden bis nach Füssen im Süden." (The Autobahn A7 runs from Flensburg in the north to Füssen in the south.)

The Autobahns in Germany are known for their efficient transportation system, allowing for quick long-distance travel. However, it is essential to follow the traffic rules and exercise caution while driving on these highways, as they can become congested during peak hours.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Autobahn" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Autobahn%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
