**Definition**

Baum is the German word for "tree". It is a plant that has a single stem or trunk, supporting branches and leaves.

**Opposites**

As Baum is a concrete noun, there is no real opposite for the word. The nearest opposite might be Luft, which means "air," as trees need air to survive.

**Synonyms**

Baum can be synonymous with Wald, which means "forest". The difference between the two is that a forest is a large area of land covered with trees, whereas Baum is just a single tree.

**Examples**

- Der Baum ist sehr alt. (The tree is very old.)
- Ich habe im Baumhaus geschlafen. (I slept in the treehouse.)
- Der Baum verliert im Herbst seine Bl√§tter. (The tree loses its leaves in the autumn.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Baum" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Baum%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
