**Definition:** Schadenfreude is a German word which literally translates to "damage-joy." It refers to the idea of taking pleasure in the misfortune of others. 

**Opposite:** The opposite of Schadenfreude would be to experience empathy, or the ability to feel and understand another person's emotions. Instead of finding joy in someone else's suffering, empathy allows us to relate to the struggles of others and offer them support and compassion. 

**Synonyms:** Other German words that have a similar meaning to Schadenfreude include "Scherz," which means tease, and "Ironie," which refers to the use of humor or sarcasm to communicate a different meaning than what is being said. 

**Examples:** Schadenfreude can manifest in a variety of situations. For example, when someone is struggling in a task or competition, we may feel a sense of satisfaction if they do not succeed. Similarly, we might feel a sense of superiority if a peer or colleague experiences a setback. The feeling of Schadenfreude can be a natural human response, but it is important to recognize when it may be harmful or hurtful to others. By practicing empathy and kindness, we can work to overcome feelings of Schadenfreude and foster a more compassionate community.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude " data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude %20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
