**Definition:**

Kühlschrank is a German word that means refrigerator in English. It is an essential household appliance used to keep food and drinks cool and fresh.

**Opposite:**

There is no direct opposite of Kühlschrank in the German language, but one could argue that the opposite of a refrigerator would be a device that heats food rather than cools it. In German, that would be a "Mikrowelle" (microwave).

**Synonyms:**

In German, there are several words that are often used interchangeably with Kühlschrank, such as "Kühlaggregat" and "Kühltruhe." Both of these words could be used to refer to a refrigerator or a freezer.

**Examples:**

- Ich habe gestern Abend etwas Essen in den Kühlschrank gestellt. (I put some food in the refrigerator last night.)
- Kannst du bitte eine Flasche Wasser aus dem Kühlschrank holen? (Can you please get a bottle of water from the fridge?)
- Wie hoch ist die Temperatur in deinem Kühlschrank? (What is the temperature in your refrigerator?)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Kühlschrank" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Kühlschrank%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
