**Wohnung** is a German word that translates to "apartment" or "flat" in English. It refers to a self-contained unit in a residential building that is used as a dwelling by one or more people.

**Synonyms:** Abstellraum (storage room), Zimmer (room), Unterkunft (accommodation)

**Opposites:** Haus (house), Einfamilienhaus (single-family house)

**Examples:**

- Meine Wohnung ist sehr gem체tlich. (My apartment is very cozy.)
- Wir suchen eine Wohnung in der N채he der Universit채t. (We are looking for an apartment close to the university.)
- Ich ziehe n채chste Woche in eine neue Wohnung. (I'm moving into a new apartment next week.)

In Germany, most people live in apartments rather than houses. Renting a Wohnung is more common than owning one, especially in larger cities where the real estate market is expensive. Apartments can vary in size and be furnished or unfurnished. It is also common for apartments to have a balcony or terrace.

Knowing the vocabulary for different types of accommodations is essential when searching for a place to live in Germany. With the word Wohnung, you are one step closer to finding your ideal home.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Wohnung" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Wohnung%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
