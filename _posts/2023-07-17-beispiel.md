## Definition

The random German word chosen for this Jekyll post is "Beispiel". The word "Beispiel" translates to "example" in English. It is derived from the Middle High German term "beischaphel", which means "pattern" or "archetype". 

## Opposite

The opposite of "Beispiel" is "Ausnahme". While "Beispiel" represents a typical instance or illustration, "Ausnahme" refers to an exception. For example, in a given situation, a specific case can be viewed as a "Beispiel" while other cases could potentially fall under the category of "Ausnahme".

## Synonym

A synonym for "Beispiel" is "Muster", which can also mean "pattern" or "model". Both words imply the idea of representing or demonstrating something. However, "Muster" is often used to describe a more specific or detailed example, like a template.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how "Beispiel" can be used in context:

1. **"Der Lehrer gab den Schülern ein Beispiel, um das Konzept zu verdeutlichen."**  
   (The teacher provided the students with an example to clarify the concept.)

2. **"Dieses Beispiel zeigt, wie man das Problem lösen kann."**  
   (This example demonstrates how the problem can be solved.)

Overall, "Beispiel" is a versatile word that is commonly used in German to refer to an example that represents or illustrates a concept or situation.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Beispiel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Beispiel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
