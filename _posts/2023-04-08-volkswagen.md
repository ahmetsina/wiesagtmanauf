Volkswagen is a German word that means "people's car." The famous car brand takes its name from this word. 

- Definition: A car brand founded in 1937 in Wolfsburg, Germany.
- Opposite: Other car brands such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz or Audi.
- Synonyms: VW (abbreviated form).
- Examples: Some of the most popular Volkswagen models are the Golf, Polo, Jetta, Passat, Tiguan, and Atlas.

Aside from being the name of the car brand, Volkswagen is also used colloquially in German to refer to any car that is affordable and reliable. It is a testament to the original intention behind the creation of the brand: to provide a car that could be owned by anyone, not just the wealthy. Over 80 years later, Volkswagen is still producing cars that are accessible to a wide range of people.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Volkswagen" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Volkswagen%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
