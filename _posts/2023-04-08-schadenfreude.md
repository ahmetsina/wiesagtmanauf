Schadenfreude is a German noun that refers to the feeling of pleasure or enjoyment derived from the misfortune of others, especially those whom one dislikes. It is a compound word, formed by two German words, 'schaden' meaning damage, harm or injury and 'freude' meaning joy or pleasure.

The word Schadenfreude has no direct English translation, but it can be described as 'malicious joy' or 'glee at someone's misfortune'.

Synonyms for Schadenfreude include "epicaricacy" and "morose delectation". These words are rarely used and are not as well-known as Schadenfreude.

The opposite of Schadenfreude is 'Mitempfinden' which means empathy or sensitivity towards others. In other words, instead of feeling joy at someone's misfortune, it means sharing and feeling someone else's pain or unfortunate situation.

An example of Schadenfreude in a sentence could be: "When her rival's project failed, Susan felt a sense of satisfaction, knowing her own chances of winning had just increased". 

In conclusion, Schadenfreude is a complex emotion that can be harmful if indulged in frequently. It is important to practice empathy and kindness towards others, especially in situations where they may be struggling or experiencing misfortune.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---
