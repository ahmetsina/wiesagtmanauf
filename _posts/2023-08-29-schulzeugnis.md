**Schulzeugnis**

The German word "Schulzeugnis" refers to a school report or certificate that provides an overview of a student's academic performance. It is typically issued at the end of a semester or school year and outlines the student's grades, conduct, and attendance. 

**Definition:**

A "Schulzeugnis" can be defined as an official document that evaluates and provides feedback on a student's progress in various subjects throughout their schooling. It serves as an important tool for both students and parents to track their academic achievements and areas of improvement. 

**Opposites:**

While there is no direct opposite term for "Schulzeugnis," it can be contrasted with a "Halbjahreszeugnis" (mid-year report) or a "Abschlusszeugnis" (graduation certificate) depending on the context. The former is issued halfway through the academic year, offering an interim evaluation of the student's performance. The latter is granted upon completion of a certain level of education, such as high school or university.

**Synonyms:**

In different regions, "Schulzeugnis" may be referred to using alternative terms such as "Zeugnis" or "Notenzeugnis." These synonyms still imply the same meaning of a school report or certificate.

**Examples:**

Below are a few examples to illustrate the usage of "Schulzeugnis":
