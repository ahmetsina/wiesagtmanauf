**Definition:**
Schadenfreude is a German word that describes the pleasurable experience of finding joy or amusement in another person's misfortune or suffering. The term is a combination of "Schaden" (harm or damage) and "Freude" (joy or pleasure). 

**Opposites:**
While Schadenfreude is a unique term, its opposite can be described as Mitleid (compassion) or Mitgef체hl (empathy). These opposing emotions involve feeling sorry for or sympathizing with someone's misfortune instead of deriving pleasure from it. 

**Synonyms:**
Although Schadenfreude is a distinct word in German, its concept can be conveyed using other phrases or expressions. Some synonyms include:

1. "Scherzhaftes Vergn체gen" - literal translation: playful pleasure
2. "Schadenl채cheln" - literal translation: schaden smile
3. "H채me" - literal translation: scorn 

**Examples:**
Below are a few examples to illustrate the usage of Schadenfreude:

1. While scrolling through social media, Maria couldn't help but feel a twinge of Schadenfreude when she saw her ex-boyfriend's embarrassing meme go viral.
2. Despite trying to hide it, Tim couldn't suppress his Schadenfreude as he watched his rival fumble during the important presentation.
3. Emma felt guilty for her Schadenfreude, but she couldn't help enjoying a bit of amusement when her classmate slipped on a banana peel.

It is important to approach Schadenfreude with caution, as deriving pleasure from others' suffering can be seen as morally questionable. However, understanding this complex emotion can offer insights into the intricacies of human psychology.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
