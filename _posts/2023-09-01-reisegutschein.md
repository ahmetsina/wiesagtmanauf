## Definition

The chosen German word is "Reisegutschein," which translates to "travel voucher" in English. It combines the words "Reise" (travel) and "Gutschein" (voucher). A Reisegutschein refers to a document or ticket that represents a pre-paid or partially paid travel package for a specific destination or service. These vouchers are often used as gifts, incentives, or rewards for various occasions, providing the recipient with the opportunity to go on a trip or experience an adventure.

## Opposite

The opposite of a Reisegutschein would be "Reisestornierung" (travel cancellation). While a Reisegutschein allows individuals to embark on planned trips with pre-arranged services, a Reisestornierung refers to the act of canceling or terminating a trip or travel arrangement. Reisestornierung can occur due to unforeseen circumstances, personal reasons, or external factors such as a natural disaster or political unrest.
