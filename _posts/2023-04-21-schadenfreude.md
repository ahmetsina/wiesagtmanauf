Schadenfreude is a German word that has made its way into English lexicon. The word "Schadenfreude" refers to the feeling of pleasure that one feels when witnessing someone else's misfortune. 

The term "Schadenfreude" is often used to describe the behavior of individuals who take pleasure in the misfortune of others. This feeling is not necessarily mean-spirited, but rather a natural human response to witnessing the struggles of others. 

Opposite to Schadenfreude are feelings of empathy, compassion, and kindness towards others. Synonyms for Schadenfreude include sadism, malicious pleasure, and spitefulness. 

Examples of Schadenfreude include laughing when someone falls down, taking pleasure in someone else's failed relationship, and enjoying someone's downfall in the workplace. However, it is important to recognize that Schadenfreude is not a positive emotion and can have negative consequences on the individual experiencing it. 

In conclusion, while Schadenfreude may provide a temporary sense of pleasure, it is never a healthy or positive way to respond to the misfortunes of others. It is important to cultivate empathy and compassion towards others, rather than taking pleasure in their pain.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
