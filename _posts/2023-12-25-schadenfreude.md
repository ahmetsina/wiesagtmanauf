## Definition
Schadenfreude is a German word that refers to the feeling of pleasure or joy one experiences when witnessing or hearing about the misfortune or pain of others. It is derived from two German words: "Schaden," meaning harm or damage, and "Freude," meaning joy or pleasure.

## Opposite
The opposite of Schadenfreude would be altruism, which involves feeling empathy and compassion for others' suffering rather than finding pleasure in it.

## Synonyms
While there is no exact synonym in the English language, the closest term would be "gloating," which implies taking pleasure in others' misfortune.

## Examples
- Seeing someone slip on a banana peel and finding it amusing instead of feeling concern or sympathy.
- Feeling delighted when a rival team loses a sports match, even if that means disappointment for their fans.
- Enjoying gossip about someone's embarrassing moment or failure rather than empathizing with them.

It is important to note that while the experience of Schadenfreude might seem satisfying in the moment, it is generally considered unethical and insensitive to derive pleasure from others' suffering.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
