**Definition:**

Hund (m) – [hʊnt]

A "Hund" is the German word for dog. It refers to a domesticated mammal belonging to the canine species (Canis lupus familiaris). Dogs have been loyal companions to humans for thousands of years and are known for their loyalty, intelligence, and ability to form strong emotional bonds with their owners.

**Opposite:**

Katze – [ˈkatsə]

The opposite of a Hund is a Katze, which means cat in German. While dogs are known for their companionship, loyalty, and energetic nature, cats are generally more independent and can display a more reserved behavior. 

**Synonyms:**

- Köter – [ˈkøːtɐ]: This is a slightly colloquial term that can be used as a synonym for Hund.
- Vierbeiner – [ˈfiːɐ̯ˌbaɪnɐ]: This term translates to "four-legged creature" and can be used to refer to any animal with four legs, including dogs.

**Examples:**

1. Mein Hund, Max, ist sehr verspielt und liebt es, Bälle zu fangen. (My dog, Max, is very playful and loves catching balls.)
2. Der kleine Hund bellte laut, als der Postbote vorbeiging. (The small dog barked loudly when the mailman walked by.)
