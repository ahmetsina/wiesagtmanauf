## Definitions

**Wald** is a German noun that refers to a forest in English. A **Wald** typically consists of a large area covered with trees, undergrowth, and various forms of vegetation. It provides habitat for numerous animal species and plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of the surrounding environment.

## Opposites

The opposite of **Wald** can be an **offene Landschaft** (open landscape) or **Gebirge** (mountain range). While a **Wald** is characterized by dense vegetation, an open landscape generally lacks significant tree coverage. Similarly, a mountain range can have scattered trees but is not characterized by a cohesive forest ecosystem.
