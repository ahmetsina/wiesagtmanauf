Sehnsucht is a German word that has no literal translation in English. It is often defined as a deep longing or yearning for something that is unattainable or far away. Sehnsucht is sometimes described as a bittersweet feeling, as the longing itself can bring both pain and pleasure.

Opposites and synonyms for Sehnsucht are difficult to find because there is no direct equivalent in English. However, similar emotions could be Nostalgie (nostalgia), Fernweh (wanderlust) or Heimweh (homesickness).

Sehnsucht can be experienced in many different situations. For example, someone might feel Sehnsucht when they hear a song that reminds them of a past lover or an old friend who they haven't spoken to in years. Or, someone might feel Sehnsucht for a place they have never been to, like a foreign country that they have always wanted to visit.

In literature, Sehnsucht is a common theme in romantic poetry and is often associated with unrequited love or yearning for a distant lover. The German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once said, "The highest thing would be to understand that all of these are but one single moment in which one is suspended between past and future."

Overall, Sehnsucht is a complex and deeply emotional word that represents a universal human experience. Whether it is love, travel or a sense of longing for something more, Sehnsucht is a feeling that everyone can relate to on some level.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Sehnsucht" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Sehnsucht%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
