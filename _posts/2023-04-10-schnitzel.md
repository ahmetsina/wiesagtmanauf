Schnitzel is a popular German dish made of breaded and fried meat, typically pork. The word Schnitzel comes from the German word "schneiden" which means "to cut". The meat is cut into thin slices, pounded out to flatten, and then coated with breadcrumbs before being fried.

Synonyms for Schnitzel include breaded meat, escalope, Wiener Schnitzel (a type of Austrian Schnitzel), and Milanesa (a similar dish popular in Latin America).

The opposite of Schnitzel could be considered a vegetarian or vegan dish, where the meat is replaced with a plant-based protein source. Another opposite could be a dish made with unbreaded and unfried meat.

Examples of dishes that feature Schnitzel include Jaeger Schnitzel (topped with a mushroom gravy), Schnitzel Parmesan (topped with tomato sauce and melted cheese), and Schnitzel Cordon Bleu (stuffed with ham and cheese). In Germany, Schnitzel is often served with sides such as potatoes, sauerkraut, or red cabbage.

Schnitzel has become popular worldwide and can be found on menus in many restaurants, particularly those serving German or European cuisine. It is a hearty and satisfying main course that is sure to be enjoyed by meat-lovers.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schnitzel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schnitzel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
