## Definition

Freiheit translates to "freedom" in English. It is a powerful and multifaceted concept that refers to the state of being free, having the ability to act, speak, or think without restraint or limitations.

While Freiheit represents the absence of constraints, its opposite would be Gefangenschaft, meaning "captivity" or "imprisonment". Gefangenschaft involves restrictions on one's freedom, usually as a result of being confined or oppressed.

## Synonyms

Some synonyms for Freiheit include Unabhängigkeit ("independence"), Selbstbestimmung ("self-determination"), and Autonomie ("autonomy"). These terms convey the idea of having control over one's actions and decisions.

## Examples

- "Nach vielen Jahren der Gefangenschaft genoss sie endlich ihre Freiheit." (After many years of captivity, she finally enjoyed her freedom.)
- "In diesem Land gibt es eine große Freiheit, verschiedene Religionen auszuüben." (In this country, there is great freedom to practice different religions.)
