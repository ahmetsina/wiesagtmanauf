Wanderlust is a German word that describes a strong desire to travel and explore the world. It is a combination of the words "wandern" which means to hike or wander and "Lust" which means desire. 

Opposite to this word is "Fernweh" which means homesickness for a place you have never been to. The word "Heimweh" meaning homesickness refers more to the feeling of missing a place you have already been.

Synonyms for wanderlust include words such as "Wanderdrang" (a strong drive to wander) and "Fernweh".

- Sie hat große Wanderlust und möchte bald in die Berge reisen.

- Meine Wanderlust wird stärker, je länger ich zu Hause bleibe.
(Translation: My wanderlust gets stronger the longer I stay at home.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Wanderlust" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Wanderlust%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
