- **Geborgenheit**: Geborgenheit is a German word meaning "security" or "feeling of being safe." It stands in opposition to the isolation and vulnerability associated with einsamkeit.
- **Gemeinschaft**: Gemeinschaft translates to "community" or "togetherness" and encompasses the sense of belonging that contrasts with the feeling of loneliness.
