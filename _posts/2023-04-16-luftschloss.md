Luftschloss is a German word that is used to describe a castle or a grand building constructed entirely in the imagination, without any basis in reality. The word is made up of two parts: "Luft", meaning air or sky, and "Schloss", meaning castle.

The term is often used to describe unrealistic or unattainable dreams or plans. It can also be used to describe idle daydreams or fantasies. Some synonyms for Luftschloss include Castle in Spain, pie in the sky, and pipe dream.

One opposite of Luftschloss could be a concrete plan. While a Luftschloss is something made up in the mind without any realistic basis, a concrete plan is well thought out and achievable. 

For example, you might say, "I'm afraid your idea of becoming a millionaire overnight is just a Luftschloss. You need to come up with a concrete plan to achieve your goals." 

Overall, Luftschloss is a useful word for describing unrealistic or imaginary ideas, dreams, and plans.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Luftschloss" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Luftschloss%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
