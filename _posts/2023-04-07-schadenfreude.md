Schadenfreude is a German word that describes the feeling of pleasure derived from the misfortunes of others. The word itself is derived from the combination of two German words: 'schaden,' which means harm or damage, and 'freude,' which means joy or pleasure. 

The opposite of Schadenfreude is 'Mitleid,' which translates into English as sympathy or empathy. Synonyms for Schadenfreude include 'gloating,' 'smirking,' and 'derision.'

For example, if someone got fired from their job, and you secretly enjoy seeing them suffer, then you would be experiencing Schadenfreude. On the other hand, if you feel bad for them and offer them words of encouragement, then you would be demonstrating Mitleid. 

In conclusion, Schadenfreude is a word that describes a feeling many of us have experienced at some point in our lives. It's important to recognize that this feeling can be harmful to both ourselves and others and strive to practice empathy instead.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
