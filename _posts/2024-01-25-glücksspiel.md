**Definition:** Glücksspiel refers to the act of participating in games or activities that involve the risk of losing money or valuables, with the aim of gaining additional wealth or prizes based on chance rather than skill. It encompasses a wide range of activities, including casino games, lotteries, sports betting, and online gambling.

**Opposites:** The opposite of Glücksspiel is "Geschicklichkeitsspiel" which translates to "skill game." Unlike Glücksspiel, Geschicklichkeitsspiele require a certain level of skill, strategy, or knowledge to succeed rather than relying solely on luck.

**Synonyms:** Some common synonyms for Glücksspiel include "Spiel um Geld" (game of money), "Hasardspiel" (game of chance), "Wetten" (bets), and "Gambling" (pronounced the same as in English).

**Examples:** Here are a few examples of Glücksspiel activities and games:

- **Blackjack**: A popular card game played at casinos where players attempt to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total of 21.
- **Slot Machines**: Mechanical or electronic devices with spinning reels that players activate with a lever or button in hopes of aligning symbols to win money or prizes.
- **Lottery**: A form of gambling where participants purchase tickets with numbers, and winners are selected through a random drawing.
- **Sports Betting**: Placing bets on the outcome of sporting events, such as predicting the winner of a football match or the total score.

Note: Engaging in Glücksspiel can be addictive and lead to financial difficulties. It is important to approach gambling responsibly and within one's means.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Glücksspiel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Glücksspiel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
