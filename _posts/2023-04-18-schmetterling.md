Schmetterling is a German word that is typically used to refer to a butterfly in English. 

**Definitions:**

A Schmetterling is an insect that has wings which are typically covered with tiny scales. These scales give the butterfly its vibrant color and striking patterns. 

**Opposites:**

The opposite of a butterfly could be considered its larvae - the caterpillar. The caterpillar of a Schmetterling is often visually unexciting in comparison to the adult butterfly. 

**Synonyms:**

Some synonyms for the word Schmetterling include "Falter" and "Tagfalter", which both translate to "butterfly" in English.

**Examples:**

- In Germany, the Schmetterling is often used as a symbol for new beginnings or change because of its transformation from a caterpillar to a butterfly.
- In his poem "Winterabend", Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote about the "Schmetterling" and its eventual death from the cold winter weather. 

Overall, the Schmetterling is a beautiful and fascinating insect that has earned its place as a cultural symbol and natural wonder.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schmetterling" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schmetterling%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
