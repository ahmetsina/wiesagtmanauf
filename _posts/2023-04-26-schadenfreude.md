Schadenfreude, a popular German compound word that translates to "taking pleasure from someone else's misfortune," is a non-translatable concept in other languages. The term refers to the enjoyment that one gains from the misfortunes of others. This applies to both minor blunders and major setbacks.

The opposite of Schadenfreude is Mitleid, which translates to compassion or empathy. While Schadenfreude involves taking pleasure in anotherâ€™s hardship, Mitleid is the opposite, where someone feels sad for another person for facing a difficult situation. Where Schadenfreude is a negative emotion, Mitleid is a positive one.

Synonyms for Schadenfreude include "gloating," "malicious joy," and "pleasure in others' pain."

Here are some examples of Schadenfreude in action: 

- When someone fails an important exam they were bragging about, and you feel relieved and pleased about it.
- When your competitor loses a client or deal that you were also pursuing, and you feel happy or satisfied about their misfortune.
- A bully who enjoys seeing others hurt or suffer, and gets a sense of power from doing so.

In conclusion, while Schadenfreude may feel satisfying in the moment, it ultimately reflects poorly on oneself to take pleasure in someone else's misfortune. Practicing empathy and compassion can lead to more positive interactions and relationships with others.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
