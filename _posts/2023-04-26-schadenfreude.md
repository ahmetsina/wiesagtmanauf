Schadenfreude, a popular German compound word that translates to "taking pleasure from someone else's misfortune," is a non-translatable concept in other languages. The term refers to the enjoyment that one gains from the misfortunes of others. This applies to both minor blunders and major setbacks.

The opposite of Schadenfreude is Mitleid, which translates to compassion or empathy. While Schadenfreude involves taking pleasure in another’s hardship, Mitleid is the opposite, where someone feels sad for another person for facing a difficult situation. Where Schadenfreude is a negative emotion, Mitleid is a positive one.

Synonyms for Schadenfreude include "gloating," "malicious joy," and "pleasure in others' pain."

Here are some examples of Schadenfreude in action: 

- When someone fails an important exam they were bragging about, and you feel relieved and pleased about it.
- When your competitor loses a client or deal that you were also pursuing, and you feel happy or satisfied about their misfortune.
- A bully who enjoys seeing others hurt or suffer, and gets a sense of power from doing so.

In conclusion, while Schadenfreude may feel satisfying in the moment, it ultimately reflects poorly on oneself to take pleasure in someone else's misfortune. Practicing empathy and compassion can lead to more positive interactions and relationships with others.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---

One interesting German word that is not commonly used in English is Schadenfreude. The Schadenfreude meaning encompasses the feeling of pleasure derived from another person's misfortune or pain. It is derived from two German nouns: Schaden (harm) and Freude (joy). 

Schadenfreude can be described as a complex emotion, as it combines feelings of delight, satisfaction, and even vindictiveness. People might say they experience Schadenfreude when they read about their friend's rival getting fired from a job or when they witness their neighbor's property being repossessed. It is important to note that Schadenfreude should not be confused with mere amusement or laughter at someone else's mistakes. Schadenfreude implies a deep emotional response with positive reinforcement.

Schadenfreude does not have a direct opposite, but it is often said to be a negative or harmful emotion. Empathy, compassion, and altruism can be considered as some of the sentiments that counteract the feeling of Schadenfreude.

Here are a few examples of Schadenfreude used in sentences:

- "Instead of feeling bad for Tom's failure, John felt Schadenfreude because he always had a higher GPA."
- "After her promotion was announced, Sarah noticed some of her colleagues experiencing Schadenfreude - she knew they had applied for the same position."
- "When Catherine saw her ex-boyfriend being publicly humiliated by his new partner, she couldn't help but feel a sense of Schadenfreude."

Overall, Schadenfreude is an interesting and complex word that captures a very particular human emotion. It is not necessarily a feeling to aspire to, but it can be helpful to be aware of its existence so that we can try to avoid being influenced by it.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---
