## Definition
Die Wolke, feminine noun, refers to a visible mass of condensed water vapor suspended in the atmosphere. It is commonly formed by the condensation of water vapor, forming droplets or ice crystals. Wolken are an essential element of the Earth's weather system and can take various forms, such as cumulus, stratus, and cirrus.

## Opposites
- Sonnenschein (sunshine): While Wolken often block the sun, Sonnenschein refers to the presence of sunlight without any cloud cover.
- Klarer Himmel (clear sky): A clear sky devoid of any clouds is the opposite of a cloudy sky.

## Synonyms
- Nebel (fog): Both Nebel and Wolken involve the presence of moisture in the air, but Nebel generally refers to a situation where visibility is significantly reduced due to dense condensation.
- Dunst (haze): Dunst is a light mist or haze that can slightly obscure objects but does not significantly impact visibility like thick clouds do.

## Examples
1. "Die kleinen Kinder sahen Bilder in den Wolken und entdeckten Tiere und Formen." (The little children saw pictures in the clouds and discovered animals and shapes.)
2. "Das Flugzeug flog durch die dichten Wolken und kam schließlich über der Wolkendecke zum Vorschein." (The airplane flew through the dense clouds and eventually emerged above the cloud cover.)
3. "Nach dem Regenschauer klarte es auf, und nur vereinzelte Wolken blieben am Himmel zurück." (After the rain shower, it cleared up, and only scattered clouds remained in the sky.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Wolke" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Wolke%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
