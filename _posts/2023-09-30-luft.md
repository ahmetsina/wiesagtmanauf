**Definition:**

Luft is a noun in the German language that translates to "Air" in English. It refers to the invisible, odorless, and essential substance surrounding the Earth that enables the existence of life on our planet. Luft is composed mainly of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and traces of other gases.

**Opposite:**

The opposite of Luft is "Unterwasser" (Underwater). While Luft refers to the mixture of gases surrounding the Earth, Unterwasser pertains to the environment below the surface of water bodies. The absence of air in this context makes it the opposite of Luft.
