***Frühstück*** is a German word that translates to "breakfast" in English. This noun refers to the first meal of the day, typically eaten in the morning to break the overnight fast. It is an essential part of German culture and is often considered the most important meal of the day.

**Opposite:** The opposite of *Frühstück* is *Abendessen*, which means "dinner" in English. While *Frühstück* is consumed in the morning, *Abendessen* is eaten in the evening and generally consists of a larger meal.

**Synonyms:** *Morgenessen* and *Fruhstuckzeit* are alternative ways to refer to breakfast in German. These synonyms can be used interchangeably with *Frühstück* to convey the same meaning.

**Examples:**
1. *Ich esse normalerweise ein gesundes Frühstück mit Müsli und frischem Obst.* (I usually have a healthy breakfast with cereal and fresh fruit.)
2. *Das Hotel bietet ein reichhaltiges Frühstücksbuffet an.* (The hotel offers a rich breakfast buffet.)

Breakfast is an important meal for Germans, and it often includes various components such as bread or rolls (*Brot oder Brötchen*), cold cuts (*Wurst*), cheese (*Käse*), eggs (*Eier*), jams (*Marmelade*) or honey (*Honig*), and hot beverages like coffee (*Kaffee*) or tea (*Tee*). This meal provides energy and sets the tone for the rest of the day.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Frühstück" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Frühstück%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
