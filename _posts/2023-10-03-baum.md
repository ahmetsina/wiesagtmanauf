**Definition:**
A Baum is a perennial plant that has an elongated stem, supporting branches, and leaves produced by photosynthesis. It typically has a long life span and can grow to be quite tall.

**Opposite:**
The opposite of a Baum is a harter Boden (hard ground), which represents the lack of vegetation or the absence of trees in an area.

**Synonyms:**
- Wald (forest)
- Gehölz (woodland)
- Grüngürtel (green belt)

**Examples:**
1. Der Baum vor meinem Haus verliert im Herbst seine Blätter. (The tree in front of my house loses its leaves in autumn.)
2. Die Vögel bauen ihre Nester im Baum. (The birds build their nests in the tree.)
3. Wenn der Wind stark bläst, bewegen sich die Äste des Baumes hin und her. (When the wind blows strongly, the tree branches sway back and forth.)

A Baum is not just a simple plant, but a symbol of nature's strength and beauty. Its presence in an environment provides shade, shelter for animals, and the essential process of oxygen production.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Baum" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Baum%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
