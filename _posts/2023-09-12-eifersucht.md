## Eifersucht

**Definition:** Eifersucht is a German word that translates to "jealousy" in English. It describes a strong emotion characterized by envy, fear of losing something or someone, and possessiveness. Eifersucht can refer to jealousy in various contexts, such as romantic relationships, friendships, or even competition.

**Opposite:** The opposite of Eifersucht is "Zufriedenheit" which translates to "contentment" or "satisfaction." While Eifersucht is fueled by negative emotions and a desire to possess what others have, Zufriedenheit is a state of being content with oneself and one's circumstances, without feeling envious or threatened.

**Synonyms:** Some synonyms for Eifersucht include "Neid" (envy), "Misstrauen" (distrust), "Missgunst" (resentfulness), and "Mißgunst" (spite).

**Examples:**

1. Sarah couldn't help but feel Eifersucht when she saw her best friend spending time with someone else.
2. Die Eifersucht zwischen den Geschwistern führte zu einem angespannten Familienverhältnis. (The jealousy between the siblings led to a strained family relationship.)
3. Paul's constant Eifersucht towards his girlfriend ultimately ruined their relationship.

Eifersucht can have both positive and negative effects depending on how it is expressed and managed. It is essential to communicate openly and honestly with others to address any feelings of envy or fear and work towards a healthier emotional state.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Eifersucht" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Eifersucht%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
