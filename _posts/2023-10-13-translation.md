## Translation

### Definition:

Translation is the process of converting written or spoken language from one language into another. It involves conveying the meaning of a text accurately while maintaining cultural nuances. Translators must possess a deep understanding of both the source and target languages to ensure accuracy and clarity in the translated text.

### Opposite:

- Original Version: The original version refers to the initial text in its original language before the translation takes place.

### Synonyms:

- Translating
- Interpretation
- Rendering

### Examples:

- "I need a translation of this document from German to English."
- "The translation from French to Spanish was done flawlessly."
- "She specializes in translating technical documents from Japanese to English."

Translation plays a vital role in global communication, facilitating understanding and exchange between people from different linguistic backgrounds. It allows for the dissemination of knowledge, culture, and commerce on an international scale.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Translation" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Translation%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
