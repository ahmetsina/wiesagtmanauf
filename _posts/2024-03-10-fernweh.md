title: Fernweh

Fernweh is a German word that describes a strong desire to travel and explore distant places. It is often translated as "wanderlust" in English but has a subtle difference in meaning. While wanderlust conveys a general longing to travel, Fernweh specifically refers to a homesickness for a place you have never been to.

Opposite of Fernweh is Heimweh, which is a homesickness for a place you have been to and want to return to. These two words capture the conflicting emotions of wanting to explore new destinations while also feeling nostalgia for familiar places.

Synonyms for Fernweh include wanderlust, nomophobia (fear of being without a mobile phone), and cabin fever (feeling trapped indoors). People experiencing Fernweh may feel restless, curious, and eager to embark on new adventures.

Example: Sarah had a severe case of Fernweh after watching a documentary about the lush jungles of Costa Rica. She yearned to explore the untamed wilderness and immerse herself in a vibrant new culture.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Fernweh" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Fernweh%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
