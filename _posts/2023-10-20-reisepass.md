## Definition 

The German word "Reisepass" refers to a travel document that allows an individual to travel internationally by granting them entry and exit permissions from various countries.

## Synonyms

- **Ausweis** ("identification card"): Though not strictly synonymous, the term "Ausweis" can be used interchangeably with "Reisepass" to mean a personal document that confirms the identity of the holder and allows them to travel abroad.

## Opposite

- **Einreiseverbot** ("entry ban"): The opposite of a "Reisepass" would be an "Einreiseverbot," which denotes a restriction imposed by a country to deny entry to individuals, whether based on legal, political, or security grounds.

## Examples

1. "Wir können unsere Reise nach Spanien fortsetzen, da wir unsere Reisepässe dabei haben."  
   ("We can continue our trip to Spain since we have our passports with us.")
   
2. "Bitte legen Sie Ihren Reisepass am Zoll vor, bevor Sie das Land verlassen."  
   ("Please present your passport at customs before leaving the country.")

By having a "Reisepass," individuals can explore the world, discover new cultures, and create unforgettable memories.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Reisepass" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Reisepass%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
