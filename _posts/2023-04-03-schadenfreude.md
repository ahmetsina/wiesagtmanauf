Schadenfreude is a German word that describes the feeling of pleasure or amusement at someone else's misfortune. It is a compound word that is made up of "Schaden," meaning harm, and "Freude," meaning joy.

Schadenfreude is sometimes used as a synonym for "gloating" or "taking pleasure in another's misfortune." It is considered to be a negative emotion, as it is often associated with feelings of jealousy and envy. However, some argue that experiencing schadenfreude can be a natural reaction to witnessing an unfair situation.

Opposites of Schadenfreude would be empathy, compassion or sympathy when one feels bad for someone else's misfortune. Synonyms could be envy, jealousy or bitterness when one feels the negative emotions of Schadenfreude.

For example, if a colleague who always brags about his accomplishments fails to get a promotion, one might feel a sense of Schadenfreude. Or, if a rival sports team loses the big game, a fan may experience Schadenfreude.

Overall, Schadenfreude is a complex emotion that can be both harmful and entertaining. It is important to recognize when we are experiencing this emotion and try to understand why we feel this way. Through introspection and self-reflection, we can develop empathy and a greater understanding of ourselves and others.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---

Schadenfreude is a German word that literally means "harm-joy" or taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune. It is a compound word consisting of "Schaden" (harm) and "Freude" (joy). This term is often used to describe the feeling of happiness or satisfaction that someone gets when they witness someone else's downfall.

**Opposites:** As schadenfreude is about taking pleasure in someone else's misfortune, the opposite would be feeling sympathy or empathy for someone when they are in trouble or experiencing difficulties.

**Synonyms:** Some synonyms for schadenfreude include gloating, joy at someone's misfortune, malicious pleasure, and epicaricacy.

**Examples:** There are many examples of schadenfreude. One would be laughing at someone who just took a nasty spill on the ice. Another example could be feeling schadenfreude towards a co-worker who just got demoted. Schadenfreude is often experienced when someone feels that the person who is experiencing misfortune deserved it in some way.

However, it is important to note that feeling schadenfreude is not a healthy emotion. It can ultimately turn into a negative feeling that can cause harm to others. It is always best to feel empathy towards others and to spread kindness whenever possible.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---
