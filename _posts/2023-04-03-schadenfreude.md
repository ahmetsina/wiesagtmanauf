Schadenfreude is a German word that describes the feeling of pleasure or amusement at someone else's misfortune. It is a compound word that is made up of "Schaden," meaning harm, and "Freude," meaning joy.

Schadenfreude is sometimes used as a synonym for "gloating" or "taking pleasure in another's misfortune." It is considered to be a negative emotion, as it is often associated with feelings of jealousy and envy. However, some argue that experiencing schadenfreude can be a natural reaction to witnessing an unfair situation.

Opposites of Schadenfreude would be empathy, compassion or sympathy when one feels bad for someone else's misfortune. Synonyms could be envy, jealousy or bitterness when one feels the negative emotions of Schadenfreude.

For example, if a colleague who always brags about his accomplishments fails to get a promotion, one might feel a sense of Schadenfreude. Or, if a rival sports team loses the big game, a fan may experience Schadenfreude.

Overall, Schadenfreude is a complex emotion that can be both harmful and entertaining. It is important to recognize when we are experiencing this emotion and try to understand why we feel this way. Through introspection and self-reflection, we can develop empathy and a greater understanding of ourselves and others.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---
