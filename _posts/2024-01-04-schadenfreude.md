**Definition:**
Schadenfreude is a German word that refers to a unique psychological phenomenon of taking pleasure or satisfaction in the misfortune or suffering of others. It is a compound word, combining "Schaden" (harm or damage) and "Freude" (joy or happiness).

**Opposite:**
The opposite of Schadenfreude would be Mitgefühl, which means compassion or empathy. While Schadenfreude involves deriving pleasure from someone else's pain, Mitgefühl involves feeling and understanding another person's suffering.

**Synonyms:**
Although there is no direct synonym for Schadenfreude in English, it is closely related to the concept of "gloating" or "taking delight" in someone's misfortune. However, Schadenfreude carries a specific cultural connotation that is not fully captured by these English terms.

**Examples:**
1. Evelyn couldn't hide her Schadenfreude when she saw her rival slip and fall on the icy sidewalk.
2. Michael's Schadenfreude was evident as he laughed loudly at his friend's failed attempt to parallel park.
3. Sarah felt a twinge of Schadenfreude when she saw her ex-boyfriend's new relationship hit a rough patch.

Schadenfreude is considered a complex emotion and can often raise ethical questions about empathy and compassion. It is important to practice kindness and understanding, avoiding the temptation of deriving pleasure from the misfortunes of others.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
