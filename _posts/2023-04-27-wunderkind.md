**Synonyms:** Genie, Ausnahmetalent, Überflieger, Hochbegabter

**Opposites:** Normal, Durchschnittlich, Mittelmaß

**Examples:**

- Lena Meyer-Landrut was a teenage Wunderkind who won the Eurovision Song Contest for Germany in 2010.

Although Wunderkind is commonly used to describe a young person with exceptional abilities, it can also be applied to adults who achieve incredible success at a young age. In recent years, tech entrepreneurs such as Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have been referred to as Wunderkinder.
