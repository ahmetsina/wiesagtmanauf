One random German word is *Abendbrot*, which literally means "evening bread". It refers to a light meal that is typically consumed in the evening, especially in northern and central parts of Germany. In some regions, people call it *Vesper* instead.

The concept of Abendbrot varies greatly depending on the region and individual preferences, but it generally consists of bread (usually dark or whole-grain), cheese, cold cuts, butter, and sometimes pickled vegetables or condiments. It is meant to be a quick, simple, and nourishing meal that can be easily prepared and enjoyed at home.

Possible synonyms for Abendbrot are *Abendessen* (evening meal) or *Brotzeit* (bread time), which is more common in southern Germany, Austria, and parts of Switzerland.

An opposite term to Abendbrot would be *Frühstück* (breakfast), which is traditionally the first and most important meal of the day in Germany. Although some people may substitute Abendbrot for a proper dinner, especially on busy weekdays, it is generally considered less substantial and formal than lunch or dinner.

Some example sentences with Abendbrot are:

- Ich esse gerne Abendbrot mit Schinken und Käse. (I like to have Abendbrot with ham and cheese.)
- Wir machen uns heute Abend ein schnelles Abendbrot. (We are having a quick Abendbrot tonight.)
- In Bayern sagt man Brotzeit statt Abendbrot. (In Bavaria, people say Brotzeit instead of Abendbrot.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Abendbrot" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Abendbrot%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
