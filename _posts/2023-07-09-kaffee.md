## Definition

Kaffee (masculine noun) is the German word for coffee, which refers to the beverage made from roasted coffee beans. It is one of the most popular drinks worldwide, enjoyed for its stimulating effect and rich aroma.

Decaffeinated coffee is often preferred by individuals who wish to avoid the stimulating effects of caffeine but still enjoy the taste and aroma of coffee.

- "Espresso" is a strong, concentrated coffee served in small portions.
- "Cappuccino" is a type of espresso-based coffee topped with frothed milk or cream.
- "Latte" or "Café au lait" is a combination of coffee and milk, typically served in a larger cup.
