## Definitions

**Jekyll** is a static site generator developed in Ruby programming language. It is commonly used to create and manage websites or blogs. By using plain text files written in Markdown or HTML, Jekyll generates a static website without requiring a database or server-side processing. It offers simplicity, ease of use, and allows developers to focus more on content creation rather than complex backend setup.

## Opposite

The opposite of Jekyll could be considered as a dynamic website, where content is generated by server-side processing or retrieved from a database in real-time. Dynamic websites provide more interactive experiences and often require advanced programming knowledge or a content management system (CMS) to create and manage.

## Synonyms

Some synonyms for Jekyll include static site generators, static site builders, or static website compilers. These terms refer to similar tools or frameworks that operate on the same principle of transforming plain text files into a fully functional website.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how Jekyll can be used in various scenarios:

1. **Personal portfolio**: A web developer can use Jekyll to create a portfolio website to showcase their projects, skills, and experience. By organizing their work into different categories, they can provide an easy-to-navigate platform for potential clients or employers.

2. **Blog**: Jekyll is often used to create and manage blogs. It allows bloggers to focus on writing content in Markdown, while Jekyll takes care of generating an optimized, static website. This eliminates the need for a dynamic CMS and improves website performance.

3. **Documentation site**: Many software projects use Jekyll to create documentation websites. By maintaining documentation in plain text files within the project repository, developers can easily update and version control the documentation alongside their code. Jekyll transforms these plain text files into a user-friendly documentation site.

4. **Company website**: Organizations can also benefit from Jekyll when creating their corporate websites. By separating content from design and code, Jekyll enables efficient collaboration between writers, designers, and developers. This results in a clean and professional website that is easy to maintain.

These examples highlight the versatility and usefulness of Jekyll in different contexts, offering a flexible solution for creating static websites efficiently.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Jekyll" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Jekyll%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
