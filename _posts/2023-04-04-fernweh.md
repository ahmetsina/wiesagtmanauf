Fernweh is a German word that describes a longing for far-off places or a desire to travel. It is often considered the opposite of homesickness, or Heimweh in German.

While the direct translation of Fernweh is "distance pain," it does not necessarily refer to a physical pain. Instead, it is more of an emotional feeling or yearning for adventure, exploration, and new experiences.

Some synonyms for Fernweh include wanderlust or travel bug. It can be used to describe a general desire to travel, or a specific longing for a particular destination.

Example sentences:

- "I have such strong Fernweh right now, I need to plan a trip abroad soon."
- "Every time I see photos of Iceland, my Fernweh intensifies."
- "She studied abroad in Spain and now has a serious case of Fernweh for Europe."\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Fernweh" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Fernweh%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
