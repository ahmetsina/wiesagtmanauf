Schadenfreude is a compound German word that is commonly used in English language. The word is a combination of two words – Schaden which means harm or damage and Freude which means joy or pleasure. In English, Schadenfreude refers to the enjoyment or pleasure derived from the misfortune or pain of others.

The opposite of Schadenfreude is empathy or sympathy. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It’s the opposite of Schadenfreude because empathy leads to compassion and a desire to alleviate the suffering of others. Sympathy, on the other hand, is feeling sorry for someone else's suffering.

Schadenfreude is often criticized because it is seen as insensitive and immoral to take pleasure in the suffering of others. However, it is a natural and common human emotion that can help people to feel better about their own situations or to feel superior to others.

Here are a few examples of Schadenfreude in action:

- Laughing at someone who slips and falls.
- Enjoying seeing someone lose an important competition or game.
- Being happy when a rival at work makes a costly mistake.

In conclusion, Schadenfreude is a complex emotion that can be both positive and negative. While it can bring temporary pleasure or happiness, it can also lead to negative feelings and behaviors. It's important to be aware of this emotion and to strive towards empathy and sympathizing with others.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
