## Definition

"**Guten Tag**" is a common German greeting used to say "good day" or "good afternoon." This phrase is widely used as a polite and formal way to greet someone during the daytime. It is customary to use "Guten Tag" until the evening, where one might then switch to "Guten Abend" ("good evening") as a more appropriate greeting.

## Opposite

The opposite of "Guten Tag" would be "Gute Nacht" ("good night"). While "Guten Tag" is used as a daytime greeting, "Gute Nacht" is used to bid someone farewell or wish them a good night. The shift from "Guten Tag" to "Gute Nacht" is typically seen in the transition from day to night.

## Synonym

A synonym for "Guten Tag" is the slightly less formal greeting "Hallo" ("hello"). While "Guten Tag" is commonly used in more official settings or when addressing strangers, "Hallo" can be used among friends, acquaintances, or in casual situations. Both greetings convey a friendly and polite tone.

## Examples

- **Formal**: Guten Tag, Herr Schmidt. Wie kann ich Ihnen helfen? (Good day, Mr. Schmidt. How can I assist you?)
- **Casual**: Hallo, Maria! Schön, dich wiederzusehen. (Hello, Maria! Nice to see you again.)
- **Transition**: Guten Tag! Bis später in der Gute Nacht. (Good day! See you later in the good night.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Guten" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Guten%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
