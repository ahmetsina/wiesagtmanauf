Here are a few examples to better understand the concept:

- In the 1960s, the Zeitgeist of the United States was characterised by a growing sense of social and political revolution, which culminated in the Civil Rights Movement, the Women's Movement, and the anti-war movement.

- During the Renaissance, the Zeitgeist was one of intellectual and artistic flourishing, marked by an explosion of creativity in literature, music, architecture, and the visual arts.
