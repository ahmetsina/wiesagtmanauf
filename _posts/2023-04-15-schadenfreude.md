Schadenfreude is a German word that translates to "pleasure derived from another's misfortune." It encapsulates the concept of feeling happy or enjoying oneself when someone else is struggling or experiencing a failure. 

This word has no exact opposite or synonym, as it is a unique and specific emotion. However, one could use words like empathy or compassion as antonyms, as these words describe feelings of understanding and caring for others. 

Examples of Schadenfreude include feeling satisfied when a disliked coworker misses an important deadline, or feeling gleeful when a rival sports team loses a game. It's important to remember that while experiencing Schadenfreude might feel good in the moment, it's not a healthy or productive way of dealing with one's own emotions. 

In conclusion, Schadenfreude is a complex and often negative emotion that can be difficult to understand or articulate. It's important to recognize when these feelings arise and work towards cultivating more positive and compassionate emotions instead.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
