## Definition
**Mauer** is the German word for **wall**. It refers to a structure made of bricks, stones, or other materials that encloses, divides, or protects an area.

## Opposites
- **Tor** (gate): While a wall separates or encloses an area, a gate allows access through the wall.
- **Durchgang** (passage): In contrast to a wall, a passage provides a way through an area without completely separating it.

## Synonyms
- **Wand**: This word can also mean "wall" but typically refers to an interior wall rather than an exterior one.
- **Abgrenzung**: Although it means "separation" or "boundary" in a general sense, it can also be used as a synonym for "wall" when referring to a physical structure.

## Examples
- Die **Mauer** umgibt den historischen Stadtkern. (The **wall** surrounds the historic city center.)
- Die Stadtmauer ist eine wichtige Touristenattraktion. (The city **wall** is an important tourist attraction.)
- Er steht mit dem RÃ¼cken zur **Mauer**. (He stands with his back to the **wall**.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Mauer" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Mauer%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
