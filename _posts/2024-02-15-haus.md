## Definitions

**Haus** is a German noun that translates to "house" in English. It refers to a building in which people live, typically one that is intended for use as a dwelling. However, **Haus** can also be used in a broader sense to indicate any building or structure, such as a public or commercial building.

## Opposites

- **Apartment** (Wohnung) - While a **Haus** typically refers to a freestanding dwelling, an **Apartment** is a housing unit within a larger building, often occupied by multiple tenants.

- **Hut** (Hut) - Unlike a **Haus**, which is a permanent and sturdy structure, a **Hut** refers to a simple and temporary shelter, such as a small cabin or a makeshift dwelling.

## Synonyms

- **Gebäude** (building) - Although **Haus** is commonly used to refer to any building, **Gebäude** is a more general term that encompasses various types of structures, including houses, offices, factories, and more.

- **Wohnstätte** (residence) - Like **Haus**, **Wohnstätte** indicates a place where people live. However, **Wohnstätte** emphasizes the concept of "residence" rather than the physical structure itself.

## Examples

- Das **Haus** meiner Großeltern ist über 100 Jahre alt. (My grandparents' **house** is over 100 years old.)

- Mein Freund wohnt in einem großen **Apartment-Haus** in der Innenstadt. (My friend lives in a large **apartment building** in the city center.)

- Das neue **Gebäude** beherbergt sowohl Büros als auch Wohnungen. (The new **building** accommodates both offices and apartments.)

- Wir haben unsere **Wohnstätte** in den Bergen gefunden und genießen die ruhige Umgebung. (We found our **residence** in the mountains and enjoy the peaceful surroundings.)

In summary, **Haus** is a versatile German word that represents the concept of a dwelling or any building structure. It can be distinguished from related terms like **Apartment** or **Hut**, and it can be interchanged with synonyms such as **Gebäude** and **Wohnstätte** depending on the context.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Haus" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Haus%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
