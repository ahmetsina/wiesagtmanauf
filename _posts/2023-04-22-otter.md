**Otter** is a German word used to refer to a semiaquatic carnivore animal that belongs to the family of Mustelidae, which includes ferrets, weasels, and badgers. An otter has a sleek body, short legs, webbed feet, and a long tail, measuring up to 1 meter in length. Otters can be found in rivers, lakes, and coastal areas.

**Synonyms**: Otters are also known as "Water dogs" in Germany.

**Opposites**: An opposite word to an otter is a "Land Animal" since otters are semiaquatic.

**Definitions**: Otters prey on fish, crustaceans, and mollusks, among other things. They are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for up to 8 minutes underwater. They use their thick fur to keep themselves warm and waterproof when swimming.

**Examples**: In some parts of Germany, especially near the rivers and coastal areas, it is possible to see groups of otters swimming and playing in the water. Otters are also frequent visitors to aquariums, zoos, and nature reserves.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Otter" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Otter%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
