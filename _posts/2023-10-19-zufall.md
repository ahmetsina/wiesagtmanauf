## Definition
"Zufall" is a German noun that means "randomness" or "chance." It refers to the occurrence or existence of something without any intention or design. It represents the idea that events or outcomes are not predetermined, but rather occur by luck or by accident.

## Opposite
The opposite of "Zufall" is "Absicht," which means "intention" or "purpose." While "Zufall" represents the absence of a plan or deliberate action, "Absicht" indicates a deliberate and planned action or outcome.

## Synonyms
Some synonyms for "Zufall" include:
- "Glück" (luck)
- "Schicksal" (fate)
- "Zufälligkeit" (randomness)
- "Unvorhersehbarkeit" (unpredictability)

## Examples
Here are a few examples of how "Zufall" can be used in sentences:

1. Der Gewinner wurde durch reines Zufall ausgewählt. (The winner was chosen purely by chance.)
2. Es war Zufall, dass wir uns im selben Café getroffen haben. (It was a coincidence that we met in the same café.)
3. Der Ausgang des Spiels hängt vom Zufall ab. (The outcome of the game depends on chance.)

So, "Zufall" represents the unpredictability and randomness of events or outcomes, contrasting with the deliberate intentions or plans represented by its opposite, "Absicht."\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Zufall" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Zufall%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
