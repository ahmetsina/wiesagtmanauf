## Definition:

Porzellan refers to porcelain in English. It is a type of ceramic material known for its delicate and translucent nature. Porcelain is made by heating materials like kaolin, feldspar, and quartz at very high temperatures. It is usually white or off-white in color, although it can be decorated with patterns, colors, or gold accents.


## Opposite:

The opposite of Porzellan, or porcelain, would be Steingut, which means earthenware in English. Unlike porcelain, earthenware is made from clay that is fired at lower temperatures. This results in a less durable and more porous material.


## Synonyms:

Synonyms for Porzellan include:
- Fayence
- Keramik
- Geschirr


## Examples:

Here are a few examples that showcase the use of Porzellan in different contexts:

1. "Ich habe ein wundersch√∂nes Porzellan-Service geerbt." (I inherited a beautiful porcelain set.)
2. "Das Porzellan zerbrach in tausend Teile, als es auf den Boden fiel." (The porcelain broke into a thousand pieces when it fell to the floor.)
3. "Unser Wohnzimmer ist mit einer Vitrine voller Porzellanfiguren dekoriert." (Our living room is decorated with a glass cabinet full of porcelain figurines.)

It is worth noting that Porzellan is often associated with fine dining and can refer to both the material itself and items made from porcelain, such as dishes, cups, and figurines.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Porzellan" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Porzellan%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
