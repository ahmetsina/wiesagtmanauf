## Definition

Zufall, derived from the German words "zu" (to, towards) and "Fall" (case), is a noun that refers to chance, coincidence, or randomness. It represents an event or outcome that occurs without any predictable pattern or planned intent.

## Opposites

   Example: Die planmäßige Ankunft des Zuges (The scheduled arrival of the train)

2. Vorhersehbar (predictable): Another opposite of Zufall is something that is easily anticipated or expected.
   Example: Die Folgen der Handlung waren vorhersehbar. (The consequences of the action were predictable)

## Synonyms

1. Glück (luck): Zufall can be synonymous with Glück, representing positive outcomes resulting from chance occurrences.
   Example: "Es war ein reiner Glücksfall, dass wir uns getroffen haben." (It was pure luck that we met)

2. Schicksal (fate): In some contexts, Zufall can also be used interchangeably with Schicksal, suggesting events dictated by destiny.
   Example: "Es war Zufall, dass er zur richtigen Zeit am richtigen Ort war." (It was fate that he was at the right place at the right time)

## Examples

1. "Durch einen Zufall habe ich die verlorenen Schlüssel wiedergefunden." (By chance, I found the lost keys.)
2. "Es war ein Zufallstreffer, dass ich genau das gefunden habe, wonach ich gesucht habe." (It was a lucky hit that I found exactly what I was looking for.)
