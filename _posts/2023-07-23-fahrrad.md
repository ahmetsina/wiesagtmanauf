## Definition
Fahrrad, a common German noun, refers to a bicycle in English. It is derived from the combination of two words, "Fahr" meaning drive, and "Rad" meaning wheel. Therefore, Fahrrad can be translated as "driving wheel" or simply "bicycle." 

## Opposite
The opposite of Fahrrad is simply "kein Fahrrad" which means "no bicycle" in English. This can refer to either not owning a bicycle or the absence of a bicycle in a certain context.

## Synonyms
Some common synonyms for Fahrrad include:
- Rad
- Zweirad (two-wheeler)
- Drahtesel (iron horse)
- Radel (slang for bicycle)

It is important to note that while Rad, Zweirad, and Radel are direct synonyms, "Drahtesel" is a more colloquial term used to describe a bicycle metaphorically as an "iron horse."
