### Definition

Kopfschmerzen is a German word that means a pain or ache in the head. It is a combination of two words: Kopf (head) and Schmerzen (pain). 

### Opposites and Synonyms

The opposite of Kopfschmerzen would be "keine Kopfschmerzen" meaning "no headache". However, some synonyms for Kopfschmerzen are "Kopfweh" and "Migräne", both of which are also used to refer to headaches in German.
