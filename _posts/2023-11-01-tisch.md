## Tisch

**Definition:** Tisch is a German noun that translates to "table" in English. It refers to a piece of furniture with a flat top and one or more legs, designed for various uses such as dining, working, or playing games.

**Opposite:** In this context, the opposite of Tisch is "Boden" (floor). While a Tisch is a raised flat surface, Boden refers to the ground or floor level.

**Synonyms:** There are several synonyms for Tisch in German, including "Tafel," "Brett," "Platte," and "Tischlein."

**Examples:**

1. Der Tisch in meiner Küche ist aus Holz. (The table in my kitchen is made of wood.)
2. Setz dich bitte an den Tisch. (Please sit at the table.)
3. Er hat seine Bücher auf den Tisch gelegt. (He placed his books on the table.)
4. Die Gäste versammelten sich um den festlich gedeckten Tisch. (The guests gathered around the beautifully set table.)

Remember that German nouns are capitalized, so Tisch always starts with a capital letter.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Tisch" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Tisch%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
