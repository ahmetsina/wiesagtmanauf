## Definition

The word "Spiegel" in German refers to a mirror, which is an object that reflects light in a way that preserves much of its original quality. Mirrors are commonly used for personal grooming, to check one's appearance, or to reflect light into a room. In a metaphorical sense, "Spiegel" can also indicate something that reflects or represents the truth or a clear image of something.

## Opposite: 

The opposite of a mirror in German is "ohne Spiegel" or "spiegellos," which means without a mirror or mirrorless. These terms are often used in the context of cameras or vehicles that do not have rearview mirrors.

## Synonyms

There are a few synonyms for "Spiegel" in German, including "Reflexionsoberfläche" (reflection surface), "Spieglung" (reflection), and "Spiegelbild" (reflection/image in a mirror). While these words may have slightly different connotations, they all refer to the concept of reflecting light or creating a mirrored image.

## Examples

1. "Sie betrachtete ihr Spiegelbild und richtete ihre Frisur."
   (She looked at her reflection in the mirror and fixed her hair.)

2. "Die Politikerin warf dem Journalisten vor, das wahre Bild der Situation nicht im Spiegel widerzuspiegeln."
   (The politician accused the journalist of not reflecting the true image of the situation in the mirror (metaphorically).)

3. "Sein Auto hat einen spiegellosen Heckspiegel."
   (His car has a mirrorless rearview mirror.)

4. "Die schöne Landschaft spiegelte sich im glitzernden Gewässer."
   (The beautiful landscape reflected itself in the shimmering water.)

Remember, a mirror not only shows your external appearance but also can be metaphorical in reflecting truth and perception.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Spiegel" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Spiegel%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
