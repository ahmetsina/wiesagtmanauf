The German word I have chosen is **Schadenfreude**. 

**Definition:** It is a compound German word made up of two parts: 'Schaden' meaning harm or damage, and 'Freude', meaning joy or pleasure, which together gives the meaning of enjoyment or pleasure derived from the misfortune of others.

**Opposite:** The opposite of Schadenfreude is 'Mitleid' which means sympathy or empathy.

**Synonyms:** Some of the synonyms of Schadenfreude in English are gloating, delight, satisfaction, and smugness.

**Examples:** Schadenfreude can occur in various aspects of life. For example, when a rival team loses a match; or reading about someone's misfortune on social media; laughing at someone who falls over, etc. One study found that Schadenfreude was experienced by up to two-thirds of respondents whenever they read bad news about celebrities or people they know.

Although Schadenfreude is not an emotion anyone would be proud to feel, it is a common and often deeply ingrained one. However, it is essential to recognize and acknowledge this emotion in ourselves as it can affect our behavior and attitude towards others.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
