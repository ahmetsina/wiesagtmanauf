Krankenwagen is a German word which means ambulance in English. The word is derived from two German words, “Kranken” meaning sick or ill, and “wagen” meaning vehicle. 

**Synonyms:** Krankenfahrzeug, Sanitätswagen, Rettungswagen

**Opposites:** Gesundheitswagen, Leichenwagen

**Definitions:** A vehicle equipped for transporting the sick or injured to the hospital.

**Examples:** 

- Wenn es jemandem nicht gut geht, sollte man den Krankenwagen rufen. (If someone is not feeling well, you should call an ambulance.)
- Der Unfallopfer wurde mit den Krankenwagen zum Krankenhaus gebracht. (The accident victim was taken to the hospital by ambulance.) 

In Germany, ambulances are typically operated by fire departments or hospitals. They are equipped with medical supplies and staffed by emergency medical personnel, who provide care to patients en route to medical facilities. 

While Krankenwagen is a relatively easy German word to learn, understanding how to properly use it in conversation will take practice. So, it’s always a good idea to continue building your German vocabulary and practicing your language skills!\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Krankenwagen " data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Krankenwagen %20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
