**Definition:**
Zeit, in German, refers to the concept of time. It is a fundamental part of our lives, guiding our actions and shaping our experiences. Zeit can be measured quantitatively using clocks and calendars, but it also has a subjective aspect that can vary depending on the individual.

**Opposites:**
- Vergangenheit (past): The opposite of Zeit refers to the time that has already occurred, the moments that have passed and can no longer be relived.
- Zukunft (future): Another opposite of Zeit is the time that is yet to come, the moments that lie ahead and have not yet been experienced.

**Synonyms:**
- Epoche (epoch): This term can be used synonymously with Zeit to refer to a distinct period in history characterized by significant events or changes.
- Dauer (duration): Dauer is a synonym that emphasizes the length or extent of time that something lasts.

**Examples:**
1. "Es war einmal vor langer Zeit..." (Once upon a time...)
2. "Ich habe keine Zeit, um ins Kino zu gehen." (I don't have time to go to the movies.)
3. "Diese Veranstaltung markiert einen bedeutenden Wendepunkt in der Geschichte unserer Zeit." (This event marks a significant turning point in our time.)
