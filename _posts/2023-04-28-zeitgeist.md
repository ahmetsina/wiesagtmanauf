**Zeitgeist** is a german word that refers to the spirit of the times or the general cultural, intellectual, or moral climate of a particular period in history. It is a combination of two german words, "Zeit" meaning time and "Geist" meaning spirit.

There's no opposite word for Zeitgeist but some synonyms could be: worldview, ethos, mentality, atmosphere or spirit of the age.

Examples of Zeitgeist are visible in art, literature, music, politics, and social behavior at different times throughout history. For instance, the 1960s in the United States have been characterized as a decade of social and political change, counterculture movements, and anti-war activism. The music of the Beatles and Bob Dylan and the literature of Jack Kerouac's "On the Road" and Ken Kesey's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" were cultural products of that era, embodying the zeitgeist of a changing society.

In Germany, the concept of Zeitgeist is important in both the arts and politics. It was used by the philosopher Hegel to describe the evolution of human history and thought, as well as the general spirit of each age. During the Weimar Republic in the early 20th century, the German Expressionist movement created art that reflected the emotional and psychological upheaval of that era. And recently, the refugee crisis in Europe has been the focus of political debates, reflecting the present-day zeitgeist of migration and multiculturalism.

In conclusion, Zeitgeist is more than just a german word. It represents the collective mindset of a society at a particular historical moment, shaping both individual and collective behaviors and beliefs.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Zeitgeist" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Zeitgeist%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
