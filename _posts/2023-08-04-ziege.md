**Definition:**

Ziege is a feminine noun in German that means "goat," referring to a domesticated mammal typically found on farms. These animals are known for their characteristic horns, which differ in shape and size depending on the breed. Goats are herbivores and are often raised for their milk, meat, or fiber.

**Opposites:**

While there is no direct opposite for the word Ziege, it is worth noting that in German, as in many languages, the masculine form, "Bock," is used to refer to a male goat, while "Ziege" specifically designates a female goat.

**Synonyms:**

- Geiß (regional variation)
- Milchziege (dairy goat)
- Mutterziege (mother goat)
- Zicklein (young goat)

**Examples:**

1. Mein Onkel hält ein paar Ziegen auf seiner Farm. (My uncle keeps a few goats on his farm.)
2. Die Ziege gab köstliche frische Milch. (The goat provided delicious fresh milk.)
3. Der Ziegenbock hat im Frühling immer viel Energie. (The male goat is always full of energy in spring.)
4. Das Zicklein hüpft vergnügt durch die Wiese. (The kid happily jumps around the meadow.)
