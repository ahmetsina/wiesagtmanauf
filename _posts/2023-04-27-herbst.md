**Herbst**

In English, *Herbst* translates to "autumn." Autumn is one of the four seasons and marks the transition from summer to winter. In the Northern Hemisphere, it typically falls between September and December. In Germany, autumn is known for its vibrant colors, as the leaves on the trees change from green to yellow, orange, and red.

**Opposite**

The opposite of autumn, or Herbst, is spring, or Frühling. Whereas autumn is a time of transition between warm and cold temperatures, spring is a time of transition between cold and warm temperatures. During the springtime, flowers start to bloom, and the leaves begin to regrow on the trees.

- *Fall* - This is a loanword from English and is commonly used in the German language.
