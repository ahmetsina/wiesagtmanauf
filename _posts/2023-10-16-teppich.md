**Definition:**

Teppich (masculine noun) refers to a floor covering made of woven or knotted fabric, typically with a thick pile or nap. It is commonly used to enhance the comfort and aesthetics of a room, as well as to insulate against cold floors. Teppich serves as a decorative element and is available in various sizes, patterns, and materials. 

**Opposite:**

The opposite of Teppich is "Fußboden" (floor). While Teppich refers to a soft covering that is added on top of the floor, Fußboden describes the actual surface of the floor itself, which may be made of wood, tiles, concrete, or other materials.

**Synonym:**

A synonym for Teppich is “Teppichboden” (carpet). Teppichboden has a similar meaning but is more specifically associated with wall-to-wall carpets, which cover the entire floor of a room.

**Examples:**

1. "Ich liebe den weichen Teppich in meinem Schlafzimmer." (I love the soft carpet in my bedroom.)
2. "Meine Großmutter hat einen antiken Teppich aus Persien." (My grandmother has an antique carpet from Persia.)
3. "Der Teppichmuster in diesem Raum ist sehr interessant." (The carpet pattern in this room is very interesting.)

In summary, Teppich is a versatile and popular floor covering that adds both comfort and style to a living space. Whether it's a cozy rug or a wall-to-wall carpet, Teppich can transform the ambiance of a room while providing insulation and visual appeal.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Teppich" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Teppich%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
