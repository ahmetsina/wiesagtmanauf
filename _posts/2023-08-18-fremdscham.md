## Definition

**Fremdscham** is a German word that describes the uncomfortable feeling or embarrassment we experience on behalf of someone else. It refers to the cringing sensation we get when witnessing someone else's awkward, embarrassing, or shameful behavior. The literal translation of "Fremdscham" is "external shame" or "foreign shame."

## Opposite

The opposite of "Fremdscham" can be described as "Stolz" (pride) or "Eigenscham" (self-shame). These emotions are associated with feeling proud or embarrassed on our own behalf rather than experiencing shame vicariously through others.

## Synonyms

While there is no exact equivalent in English, Fremdscham can be related to the concept of "embarrassment by proxy" or "vicarious embarrassment." Other suggested synonyms include "cringe" or "second-hand embarrassment" but they only partially capture the essence of the German term.

## Examples

1. Imagine sitting in a crowded theater and witnessing a performer who completely forgets their lines. As the audience collectively cringes, feeling embarrassed on their behalf, they experience Fremdscham.

2. Watching a reality TV show where participants engage in socially uncomfortable situations can induce Fremdscham. Observing someone make a faux pas or a social blunder creates that uncomfortable feeling of embarrassment on their behalf.

3. Attending an event where a speaker goes off on a tangent and starts sharing inappropriate anecdotes might lead to Fremdscham for the entire audience.

4. When a friend starts flirting awkwardly with someone they clearly have no chance with, you might feel Fremdscham for them, wanting the interaction to end swiftly.

5. In a comedic context, watching a character in a movie or TV show embarrass themselves due to acts of clumsiness or misunderstanding can prompt feelings of Fremdscham.

Overall, Fremdscham captures the recognition and discomfort we feel when faced with the embarrassing actions or situations of others. It allows us to empathetically relate to their shame while simultaneously feeling grateful that we are not the ones experiencing it firsthand.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Fremdscham" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Fremdscham%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
