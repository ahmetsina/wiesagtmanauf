**Zeitgeist** is a powerful German word used to describe the cultural, intellectual, and moral climate of an era. It is derived from the words Zeit (time) and Geist (spirit). The term was coined by the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and has since become an important concept in the fields of art, literature, and philosophy.

**Synonyms**: spirit of the times, trend, atmosphere

**Opposites**: outdated, irrelevant, out of touch

**Examples**: The Zeitgeist of the 1920's was characterized by a sense of rebellion, freedom, and creativity in art and literature. The Zeitgeist of the 21st century is driven by technology, social media, and a need for instant gratification. The artists of the Bauhaus movement captured the Zeitgeist of their time with their innovative designs and functionalist approach to art and architecture. In contrast, the Romantic poets expressed a nostalgia for the past and a rejection of the industrialized present, revealing a different Zeitgeist altogether.

Understanding the Zeitgeist of a particular era is important for artists and historians alike, as it provides insight into the beliefs, values, and concerns of that time. It helps us to understand how ideas and art forms develop in response to social, political, and economic changes.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Zeitgeist" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Zeitgeist%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
