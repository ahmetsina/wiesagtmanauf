## Schadenfreude

[Schadenfreude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude) is a German word that has made its way into the English language due to its unique and specific meaning. It is derived from the combination of the words "Schaden," which means harm or damage, and "Freude," which means joy or pleasure. 

Schadenfreude refers to the experience of taking pleasure or finding satisfaction in the misfortune or suffering of others. It is an emotion that can be complex and controversial, as it involves deriving happiness from someone else's pain. 

### Opposite of Schadenfreude

While there isn't a direct opposite word for Schadenfreude, the concept of feeling empathy or compassion towards others can be considered its antithesis. Empathy involves understanding and sharing the feelings of others without taking joy in their misfortune. Feeling empathy encourages us to offer support and assistance to those in need instead of deriving pleasure from their suffering.
