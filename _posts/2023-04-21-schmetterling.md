**(Note to reader: Schmetterling means butterfly in German)**

Schmetterling is a beautiful word that describes the fluttering butterfly. The word itself is composed of two parts "Schmet" and "erling" where "Schmet" has been derived from "schmetten" which means cream while "erling" is a diminutive in German, which is used to create names of small creatures. 

**Opposites:** The opposite of Schmetterling is "Raupe" which means caterpillar. A caterpillar transforms into a butterfly and when it is in its caterpillar stage it is completely different than when it is a butterfly. Hence, Raupe and Schmetterling are opposites.

**Synonyms:** Although Schmetterling is a unique word in German language, there are some other words which can be used alternatively. These include: "Falter", "Zitronenfalter" and "Mauerfuchs". Falter is the common word for butterfly which is used in most German speaking regions. Zitronenfalter refers to a particular type of butterfly that has spots on its wings and resembles a Lemon. Mauerfuchs is the German name for Small Tortoiseshell.

**Examples:** One of the famous German poets, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, wrote a poem about a Schmetterling. The poem goes like this: 

**Das Mädchen**
Ihr Herzlein ist von Zartigkeit,
Ein Schmetterling darauf sich niederläßt,
Und, ach! es ist in ihrer Hand zerdrückt.

**Translation:**

**The Maiden**
Her little heart is sensitive,
A butterfly alights upon it,
But, ah! in her hand it crushes.

In Germany, butterflies are admired and recognized for their beauty and the role they play in pollinating flowers. They are a symbol of summer and are also used in art, literature and music.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schmetterling" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schmetterling%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---
