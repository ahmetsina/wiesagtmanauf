## Definition

Schadenfreude is a German word that describes the pleasure one derives from the misfortune or suffering of others. It is a compound word, combining "Schaden" (harm) and "Freude" (joy). Schadenfreude is often used to describe the feeling of satisfaction or gratification that arises when witnessing someone else's downfall or failure.

## Synonyms

While there is no direct synonym for Schadenfreude in the English language, similar concepts can be expressed using phrases such as "taking pleasure in someone's misfortune" or "delighting in another's suffering."

## Opposites

The opposite of Schadenfreude, in terms of empathetic response, would be feelings of empathy, compassion, or sympathy towards others. These emotions involve understanding, supporting, and caring for others during difficult times rather than finding joy in their misfortune.

## Examples

1. Watching a rival sports team lose a match and feeling a sense of satisfaction.
2. Feeling enjoyment or amusement when seeing a celebrity stumble on the red carpet during an awards show.
3. Chuckling at a friend's embarrassing moment instead of offering support or consolation.

Schadenfreude, while a natural reaction in some situations, is also considered to be a complex and controversial emotion. It reveals the darker aspects of human nature and can be seen as a form of cruelty or even envy. Practicing empathy and kindness towards others is often encouraged as a more positive and supportive approach to relationships and interactions.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
