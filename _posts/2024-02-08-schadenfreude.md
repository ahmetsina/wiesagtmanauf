## Examples

### Scenario 1:

Alice accidentally spills coffee on her white blouse just before an important meeting. Bob, who has a tendency towards Schadenfreude, can't help but smile and feel a sense of satisfaction in seeing Alice's misfortune. 

### Scenario 2:

Tom, on the other hand, has a strong sense of empathy. He sees Alice's coffee accident and offers to help her clean up. He tries to console her, realizing she must be feeling embarrassed and upset. Tom's reactions demonstrate his lack of Schadenfreude and his natural inclination towards compassion.
