**Zunge** is a German word that means "tongue" in English. It can refer to the anatomical part of the body that is located in the mouth and is responsible for tasting, swallowing, and speaking. But it can also be used to describe the way people speak or the language they use.

**Opposites/Synonyms:** The opposite of **Zunge** is "Stille" (silence) as silence is the absence of speech or sound. Synonyms include "Sprache" (language) and "Rede" (speech).

(The tongue is an important part of the digestive system.)

2. Ihre Zunge ist so scharf, dass sie immer alle kritisiert.
