**Definition:** Schadenfreude is a German term that means pleasure taken from someone else's misfortune. It is a compound of the German words "Schaden" (harm) and "Freude" (joy), which together mean "harm joy." Schadenfreude is often considered a negative emotion, but some argue that it is a natural part of human psychology.

**Opposite:** The opposite of Schadenfreude is "Mitleid" (compassion). When we feel Mitleid, we experience empathy for someone else's suffering and want to alleviate their pain.

**Synonyms:** While Schadenfreude does not have a direct synonym in the English language, some closely related terms include "gloating," "smugness," and "satisfaction." However, these terms do not capture the full complexity of Schadenfreude as a cultural concept.

**Examples:** A common example of Schadenfreude is when someone who has been boasting about their success suddenly fails, and others feel a sense of satisfaction or pleasure because they believe the person had it coming. Another example is when a rival team loses a game, and fans of the winning team cheer and taunt the other side. In both cases, Schadenfreude involves deriving enjoyment from others' misfortune. However, it is essential to recognize that Schadenfreude can be harmful and even damaging if it leads to cruelty or indifference toward others.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---

**Schadenfreude**

One of the most famous German words is "Schadenfreude". It is a combination of two words "Schaden" means harm and "Freude" means joy. Schadenfreude is a feeling of pleasure derived from the misfortune of others. It is not a positive emotion but it is human nature to feel satisfied when someone else gets what they deserve because they were mean or spiteful.

**Opposite and Synonym**

The opposite of Schadenfreude is "Mitempfinden" which means empathy. Empathy is the ability to understand or share feelings with others. In contrast, Schadenfreude is a lack of empathy, as you rejoice in someone's pain or failure.

A synonym for Schadenfreude is "Scherzhaftigkeit" which means the tendency to play a joke on people. However, Scherzhaftigkeit is usually light-hearted and not malicious like Schadenfreude.

**Examples**

A simple example of Schadenfreude is when you smile or even laugh at someone who falls off a bike. However, it can occur in more complicated situations, such as when you are happy about your rival's failed project or your colleague's mistake at work.

In the end, it is essential to recognize Schadenfreude and strive to develop empathy. We should try to put ourselves in other people's shoes and appreciate their achievements, rather than gloating over their misfortunes.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
