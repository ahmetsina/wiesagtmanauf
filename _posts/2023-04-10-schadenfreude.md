**Definition:** Schadenfreude is a German term that means pleasure taken from someone else's misfortune. It is a compound of the German words "Schaden" (harm) and "Freude" (joy), which together mean "harm joy." Schadenfreude is often considered a negative emotion, but some argue that it is a natural part of human psychology.

**Opposite:** The opposite of Schadenfreude is "Mitleid" (compassion). When we feel Mitleid, we experience empathy for someone else's suffering and want to alleviate their pain.

**Synonyms:** While Schadenfreude does not have a direct synonym in the English language, some closely related terms include "gloating," "smugness," and "satisfaction." However, these terms do not capture the full complexity of Schadenfreude as a cultural concept.

**Examples:** A common example of Schadenfreude is when someone who has been boasting about their success suddenly fails, and others feel a sense of satisfaction or pleasure because they believe the person had it coming. Another example is when a rival team loses a game, and fans of the winning team cheer and taunt the other side. In both cases, Schadenfreude involves deriving enjoyment from others' misfortune. However, it is essential to recognize that Schadenfreude can be harmful and even damaging if it leads to cruelty or indifference toward others.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
