**Magnet** [noun]

1. Definition: A magnet is an object that possesses a magnetic field and attracts certain materials, such as iron or steel.

2. Opposite: While magnets attract certain materials, their opposite would be objects that repel magnetic materials, such as diamagnetic substances.

3. Synonym: In German, a synonym for "Magnet" is "Magnetstein" or "Magnetk√∂rper."

4. Example: One common example of a magnet is the type used to attach papers to a refrigerator door. These magnets are made of materials that can produce a magnetic field.

Remember that magnets have both a north and south pole. Similar poles repel each other, while opposite poles attract.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Magnet" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Magnet%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
