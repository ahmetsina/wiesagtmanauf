### Definition

"**Weltanschauung**" refers to the fundamental beliefs, attitudes, and ideas about the world and one's place within it. It is the way in which an individual or a group perceives and interprets reality.

For example, in German culture, there is a strong emphasis on the importance of community and social harmony. This can be seen in the concept of "Ordnung," which views order and structure as inherently valuable, and in the way that a sense of responsibility to one's fellow citizens is woven into the fabric of daily life.

### Opposite

The opposite of "Weltanschauung" would be a worldview that is characterized by a lack of beliefs or a lack of a coherent and consistent set of ideas about the world. This might be seen as a nihilistic or a nihilistic-esque approach to life that rejects the idea of a coherent and meaningful universe.

### Synonym

A synonym for "Weltanschauung" might be the term "philosophy." Both words refer to a set of beliefs, ideas, and attitudes that shape a person's view of the world.

### Example

An example of a "Weltanschauung" might be the worldview of a devout Christian, who believes that the world was created by God and that it is infused with both meaning and purpose. Another example might be the way in which a Buddhist might view the world as a reality that is marked by the impermanence of all material things, and in which the ultimate goal is to achieve enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of suffering.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Weltanschauung" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Weltanschauung%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
