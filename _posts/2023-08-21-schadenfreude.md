## Definition
Schadenfreude is a German word that represents the feeling of pleasure derived from the misfortune of others. It combines the words "Schaden" meaning harm or damage, and "Freude" meaning joy or delight. Schadenfreude refers to the experience of taking pleasure in someone else's pain or downfall.

## Opposites
Opposite to Schadenfreude, we find "Mitleid" which translates to sympathy or compassion. Instead of feeling joy from another person's suffering, Mitleid engenders feelings of concern, empathy, and a desire to help.

## Synonyms
While Schadenfreude is a unique word in the German language, similar concepts exist in other cultures and languages. For example, "epicaricacy" is an English term used to describe a similar enjoyment of another person's misfortune. "Gloating" and "satisfaction" are also somewhat synonymous with Schadenfreude but do not capture the specific nuance of deriving pleasure from someone else's pain.

## Examples
Here are a few examples to illustrate the concept of Schadenfreude:

1. When a rival team loses a crucial match, some fans may experience Schadenfreude, finding joy in their opponents' defeat.
2. Witnessing a mean-spirited person experiencing a setback can invoke a sense of Schadenfreude, as their misfortune feels like a form of comeuppance.
3. Reading about a celebrity's downfall in the tabloids may trigger a sense of Schadenfreude for some, as they revel in the idea of their glamorous lives crumbling.

It is important to note that while Schadenfreude is a common human emotion, its expression should be tempered with empathy and compassion. Rejoicing in the misfortune of others can be seen as morally wrong or cruel.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
