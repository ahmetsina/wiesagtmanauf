## Definition
Schadenfreude is a German word that represents the feeling of pleasure derived from the misfortune of others. It combines the words "Schaden" meaning harm or damage, and "Freude" meaning joy or delight. Schadenfreude refers to the experience of taking pleasure in someone else's pain or downfall.

## Opposites
Opposite to Schadenfreude, we find "Mitleid" which translates to sympathy or compassion. Instead of feeling joy from another person's suffering, Mitleid engenders feelings of concern, empathy, and a desire to help.

## Synonyms
While Schadenfreude is a unique word in the German language, similar concepts exist in other cultures and languages. For example, "epicaricacy" is an English term used to describe a similar enjoyment of another person's misfortune. "Gloating" and "satisfaction" are also somewhat synonymous with Schadenfreude but do not capture the specific nuance of deriving pleasure from someone else's pain.

## Examples
Here are a few examples to illustrate the concept of Schadenfreude:

1. When a rival team loses a crucial match, some fans may experience Schadenfreude, finding joy in their opponents' defeat.
2. Witnessing a mean-spirited person experiencing a setback can invoke a sense of Schadenfreude, as their misfortune feels like a form of comeuppance.
3. Reading about a celebrity's downfall in the tabloids may trigger a sense of Schadenfreude for some, as they revel in the idea of their glamorous lives crumbling.

It is important to note that while Schadenfreude is a common human emotion, its expression should be tempered with empathy and compassion. Rejoicing in the misfortune of others can be seen as morally wrong or cruel.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---

### Definition:

Schadenfreude is a German word that has become well-known in many languages. It refers to the feeling of pleasure or joy one experiences when witnessing another person's misfortune, failure, or suffering. It combines the words "Schaden" meaning harm or damage, and "Freude" meaning joy or delight. 

### Opposites:

While it may seem counterintuitive, it is important to note that Schadenfreude does not necessarily have an exact opposite in the German language. However, the idea of empathy or sympathizing with someone's misfortune can be seen as contrasting, as it involves feeling compassion instead of joy when others experience difficulties. 

### Synonyms:

Although Schadenfreude is a unique concept, other terms in German can closely convey a similar meaning. These include:

- Genugtuung (satisfaction): This word refers to the feeling of satisfaction or contentment one may experience upon seeing another person face misfortune or failure.
- Häme (spite): This term portrays taking pleasure in someone else's pain with a hint of malicious intent or spitefulness.
- Frohlocken (gloating): While not an exact synonym, Frohlocken denotes rejoicing or reveling in the misfortune or downfall of others.

### Examples:

1. "Als sie hörte, dass ihr Nachbar seinen Job verloren hatte, konnte sie ihre Schadenfreude nicht verbergen." (When she heard that her neighbor had lost his job, she couldn't hide her Schadenfreude.)

2. "Trotz des schlechten Wetters und meiner misslichen Lage konnte ich nicht anders, als Schadenfreude über den gestrandeten Touristen zu empfinden." (Despite the bad weather and my own unfortunate situation, I couldn't help but feel Schadenfreude towards the stranded tourist.)

3. "Statt mitgefühlend zu reagieren, verspürte sie Schadenfreude über ihren Kollegen, der den Vortrag vermasselte." (Instead of reacting with empathy, she felt Schadenfreude towards her colleague who messed up the presentation.)

4. "Nachdem er den Wettbewerb gewonnen hatte, war er überwältigt von der Schadenfreude seiner Konkurrenten." (After winning the competition, he was overwhelmed by the Schadenfreude of his competitors.)

Despite its complex nature and potentially negative connotations, Schadenfreude serves as a reminder of the intricate range of human emotions.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Schadenfreude" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Schadenfreude%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
