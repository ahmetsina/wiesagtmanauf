Sonnenschein is a German word that means sunshine. It is a compound word made up of 'Sonne' which means sun and 'Schein' which means shine. In German, it is used both literally and metaphorically.

**Definition**<br>
The literal definition of Sonnenschein is the light and warmth that comes from the sun. It is used to describe a bright, sunny day with blue skies and the warmth of the sun. Weather forecasts often use this word to describe a day that is expected to be sunny.

**Opposite**<br>
The opposite of Sonnenschein is Regen, which means rain. When the weather is rainy and cloudy, Germans might describe it as 'kein Sonnenschein heute' which translates to 'no sunshine today.' 

**Synonym**<br>
The synonym of Sonnenschein is Sonnenlicht, which means sunlight. Both words describe the light and warmth that comes from the sun, but Sonnenlicht is a more formal word that is often used in scientific contexts.
