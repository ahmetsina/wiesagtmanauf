## Definition

Zufall, in its most basic sense, means "random" in German. It refers to an event or outcome that occurs without any specific intention, purpose, or pattern. The word is derived from the combination of the prefix "zu-" (meaning "to" or "towards") and "Fall" (meaning "case" or "event").

## Opposite

The opposite of zufall is "Absicht" (intention). While zufall pertains to something happening randomly or by chance, absicht implies a deliberate, planned action or purpose.

Example sentence:
- Der Gewinner der Lotterie war reiner Zufall. (The winner of the lottery was purely random.)
- Ihre Ankunft war kein Zufall. Es war von Anfang an geplant. (Their arrival was not random. It was planned from the beginning.)

## Synonyms

There are several synonyms for zufall, depending on the context and usage:
- "Willkür" (arbitrariness): This word implies a decision or action that is based on random choice or personal preference, without objective criteria or reasoning.
- "Losentscheid" (deciding by lot): Often used in the context of resolving a tie or determining a winner by drawing lots or using a random selection method.
- "Glücksspiel" (gambling): Refers to games of chance that rely on random outcomes or luck, such as card games or slot machines.

Example sentence:
- In diesem Spiel entscheidet der Zufall, wer gewinnt. (In this game, chance determines the winner.)
- Die Auswahl des Gewinners erfolgte durch einen Losentscheid. (The winner was determined by a drawing of lots.)

Zufall can also be used in idiomatic expressions, such as "aus Zufall" (by chance) or "im Zufallsprinzip" (randomly).

Remember, zufall is a versatile word that encompasses the concept of randomness. Its synonyms and antonyms further illustrate its various applications in German language and culture.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Zufall" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Zufall%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---
