**Autobahn**

- Definitions:
Die Autobahn (plural: Autobahnen) is the German word for "motorway" or "highway." It refers to a controlled-access road system specifically designed for high-speed vehicular traffic, connecting cities and regions across Germany. These roads are typically free of traffic signals, have multiple lanes, and are built to accommodate high-speed travel.

- Opposite:
The opposite of Autobahn would be a "Landstraße," which translates to "country road" or "secondary road." Unlike the Autobahn, these roads often have lower speed limits and may have intersections with traffic lights or stop signs.

- Synonyms:
Other synonyms for Autobahn include "Fernverkehrsstraße" (long-distance road) and "Kraftfahrstraße" (motorized road).

- Examples:
1. "Um schnell von Berlin nach München zu gelangen, muss man die Autobahn nehmen." (To quickly get from Berlin to Munich, one must take the Autobahn.)
2. "Die Autobahn A7 ist eine der längsten Autobahnen Deutschlands." (The A7 Autobahn is one of the longest highways in Germany.)

The Autobahn plays a significant role in Germany's transportation infrastructure, offering efficient and convenient travel options for both domestic and international journeys.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Autobahn" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Autobahn%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
