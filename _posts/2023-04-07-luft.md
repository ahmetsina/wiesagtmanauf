Luft (feminine noun) is a common German word that translates to 'air' in English. It refers to the mixture of gases that make up the earth's atmosphere, which we breathe in and out.

### Definitions

Luft can be defined in various contexts like meteorology or aviation. Meteorologically Luft refers to a gas without any distinct structure or configuration, which is perceived through its sensible properties such as pressure, temperature, and humidity. In aviation, Luft is used to refer to the space in which the aircraft move and fly.

### Opposites

The opposite of Luft is often referred to as Vakuum (vacuum), which is an area that does not have any gaseous substance or air. 

### Synonyms

Air, which is the direct translation of Luft, has various synonyms in German, most notably • Atem (breath), • Hauch (breath), • Wind (wind) • Lüftung (ventilation) • Dunst (mist).

### Examples

Here are a few examples of how Luft is used in context:

- Die Luft in dieser Gegend ist sehr frisch. (The air in this area is very fresh.)
- In der Flugzeugkabine schließt sich die Luftzufuhr. (The air supply in the aircraft cabin is closed.)
- Das U-Boot könnte seine Luftvorräte bis zu acht Stunden aufrechterhalten. (The submarine could maintain its air supply for up to eight hours.)

Overall, Luft is a vital component of life that we take for granted. Without air, we would not be able to breathe, and life on earth would cease to exist.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Luft" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Luft%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>---
