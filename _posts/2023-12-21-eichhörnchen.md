Eichhörnchen can be broken down into two parts: *Eiche* meaning oak and *Hörnchen* meaning little horn. This name is derived from their frequent presence around oak trees and their characteristic tufted ears.

**Definition:** Eichhörnchen describes a rodent belonging to the family Sciuridae. These animals are known for their playful behavior, bushy tails, and ability to climb trees. Squirrels use their sharp claws to effortlessly navigate branches, making daring leaps and bounds.
