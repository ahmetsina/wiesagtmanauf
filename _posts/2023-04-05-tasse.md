**Definition**  
"Tasse" is a German word that means cup. It is a household item that is commonly used for drinking liquids such as coffee, tea, or hot chocolate. It is often made of ceramic or porcelain with a handle for easy gripping.

**Opposites**  
The opposite of "Tasse" in German would be "Untertasse," which means saucer. While the cup is used for drinking, the saucer serves as a base or coaster for the cup.

**Synonyms**  
There are a few synonyms for "Tasse" in German, including "Becher," which means mug, and "Kanne," which means pot. Becher is typically used for larger cups that hold more liquid, while Kanne is used for containers with a spout for pouring.

**Examples**  
- "Kannst du mir bitte eine Tasse Kaffee bringen?" (Can you please bring me a cup of coffee?)
- "Ich trinke meinen Tee aus einer sch√∂nen Porzellantasse." (I drink my tea from a beautiful porcelain cup.)
