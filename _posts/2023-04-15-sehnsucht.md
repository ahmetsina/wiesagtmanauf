**Sehnsucht**  [ˈzeːnˌzʊxt] is a German word that doesn't translate well into English with just one word. It can be described as a feeling of longing, yearning or nostalgia for something that you may have never experienced before or something that may not even exist.

**Synonyms:** longing, yearning, pining, nostalgia, yearning, desire, passionate longing.

**Opposites:** contentment, satisfaction, fulfilment, happiness, satiation.
