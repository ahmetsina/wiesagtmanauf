## Definitions

**Autobahn** is a German word that translates to "motorway" or "expressway" in English. It refers to the extensive network of highways in Germany and is known for its unrestricted speed limits in certain sections.

In a broader sense, the term *Autobahn* can also refer to similar highway systems in other countries, although the German Autobahn system is particularly famous for its quality and efficiency.

## Opposites

The opposite of an Autobahn can be a *Landstraße* (country road) or *Stadtstraße* (city street), which have lower speed limits, more intersections, and generally less traffic flow.

Additionally, outside of Germany, where the term Autobahn is not commonly used, one could consider a regular highway or motorway as an opposite concept since they often have lower speed limits, more complex traffic infrastructure, or toll requirements.

## Synonyms

Although the term Autobahn is primarily used in German-speaking countries, there are equivalent highway systems in other parts of the world. Some synonyms for Autobahn include:

- **Autoroute** (French)
- **Autopista** (Spanish)
- **Autostrada** (Italian)
- **Interstate** (United States)

## Examples

1. *Bitte folgen Sie der Autobahn A3 bis zur nächsten Ausfahrt.* (Please follow the A3 Autobahn until the next exit.)
2. *Auf der Autobahn sind keine Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzungen vorhanden.* (There are no speed limits on the Autobahn.)
3. *Die Autobahn ist wegen Bauarbeiten derzeit gesperrt.* (The Autobahn is currently closed due to construction work.)

The Autobahn system plays a significant role in Germany's transportation infrastructure, offering efficient and rapid travel across the country.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Autobahn" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Autobahn%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
