## Definitions
1. Butter is a noun in the German language that refers to a dairy product made from churning cream or milk until it reaches a semi-solid state. This creamy substance is commonly used as a spread or as an ingredient in cooking and baking.

2. In a figurative sense, "Butter" can also be used to describe someone or something that is smooth, creamy, or pleasant in nature. This definition is often used in idiomatic expressions or in poetic language.

## Opposites
- Margarine: While butter is made from dairy products, margarine is an alternative derived from vegetable oils. It is considered an opposite to butter due to its plant-based composition.

## Synonyms
- Schmalz: In some contexts, "Schmalz" can be used as a synonym for butter. It refers to a type of rendered animal fat used similarly to butter in cooking, particularly in German cuisine.
