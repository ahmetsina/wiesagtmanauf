**Apotheke** is a German word that refers to a pharmacy or a drugstore. In Germany, a licensed pharmacist operates an Apotheke where customers can obtain prescription medication and over-the-counter remedies. 

Apotheke comes from the Ancient Greek word "apothḗkē," which means "storehouse" or "repository." This reflects the original purpose of pharmacies, which were storehouses of plant-based medicines and home remedies.

**Opposites** of Apotheke in German include "Lebensmittelgeschäft" (grocery store) or "Drogerie" (drugstore). 

**Synonyms** for Apotheke include "Apotheke zum weißen Engel" (pharmacy to the white angel) and "Apotheke zum Mohren" (pharmacy to the black Moor).

**Examples** of Apotheke in use:
- "Ich gehe in die Apotheke, um eine Schmerztablette zu kaufen." (I'm going to the pharmacy to buy a painkiller.)
- "Ich war gestern in der Apotheke, um meine Antibiotika abzuholen." (I went to the pharmacy yesterday to pick up my antibiotics.)\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Apotheke" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Apotheke%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
