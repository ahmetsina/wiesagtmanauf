*Scheinheilig* is a German word that is commonly used to describe someone who pretends to be virtuous or holy but actually possesses the opposite characteristics. A *Scheinheiliger* is someone who might preach virtuous behavior but then engages in immoral actions, or someone who outwardly displays devotion but is actually insincere in their beliefs. 

The word itself is a compound of two German words: *Schein*, meaning "appearance" or "semblance," and *heilig*, meaning "holy." 

Some possible synonyms for *Scheinheilig* include *heuchlerisch* (hypocritical) and *verlogen* (deceitful), while antonyms might include *redlich* (honest) and *aufrichtig* (sincere). 

Here are a few examples of how *Scheinheilig* might be used in context: 

- *Er hat immer über die Bedeutung der Ehrlichkeit gesprochen, aber dann hat er das Geld gestohlen - er ist wirklich ein Scheinheiliger.* (He always spoke about the importance of honesty, but then he stole the money - he's really a hypocrite.)
- *Ich glaube nicht, dass sie wirklich so fromm ist, wie sie vorgibt - das ist einfach nur scheinheilig.* (I don't believe she's really as pious as she pretends - it's just hypocritical.)
- *Die Regierung hat behauptet, dass sie sich um das Wohlergehen der Bürger sorgt, aber in Wirklichkeit handelt sie nur aus Eigeninteresse - das ist scheinheilig.* (The government claimed it was concerned about the wellbeing of citizens, but in reality it only acted out of self-interest - that's hypocritical.) 

Overall, *Scheinheilig* is a useful word to know when discussing behavior or actions that seem virtuous on the surface but are actually insincere or false.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Scheinheilig" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Scheinheilig%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
