Augenblick is a German word that translates to “moment” in English. This word refers to a very short period of time, a fleeting moment or a blink of an eye.

Synonyms of Augenblick are Sekunde (second), Moment, Minute (minute), and Stunde (hour) which all express a certain amount of time. Augenblick, in contrast, is a very specific term that is used to describe a moment that is so brief that it almost defies definition.

The opposite of Augenblick would be Ewigkeit (eternity) which is an infinite amount of time. 

Examples of using Augenblick:

- "Ich werde mich an diesen Augenblick für immer erinnern." (I will remember this moment forever.)
- "Der Augenblick, in dem sie ihm ihre Gefühle gestand, war unvergesslich." (The moment she confessed her feelings to him was unforgettable.)
- "Einen Augenblick bitte, ich muss kurz etwas erledigen." (One moment please, I need to take care of something quickly.)

Augenblick is a word that carries a certain depth of emotion and meaning. It reminds us of the fleeting nature of time and how important it is to appreciate the moments we have.\ <a id="yg-widget-0" class="youglish-widget" data-query="Augenblick" data-lang="german" data-components="8412" data-auto-start="0" data-bkg-color="theme_light" data-title="How%20to%20pronounce%20Augenblick%20in%20German"  rel="nofollow" href="https://youglish.com">Visit YouGlish.com</a><script async src="https://youglish.com/public/emb/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
